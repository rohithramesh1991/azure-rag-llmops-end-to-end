Fragrances of blackberry, plum, wild strawberry and raspberry mingle with creamy lactic notes over a background of fine, exotic wood (sandalwood).

205,Abbona Terlo Ravera Barolo 2011,,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",Red Wine,90,"The 2011 vintage was rather warm, which led to fruity and soft characteristics in the aroma and in the mouth. Ravera 2011 is ideal for someone who would like a great Barolo, but does not want to wait years to open it. Note that with this vintage and in the future, this Barolo, which was called Barolo Terlo Ravera in the past, will be simply called Ravera.

An ideal wine for combining seasoned cheese and red meat."
207,Abeja Cabernet Sauvignon 2006,,"Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,91,"Gorgeous, refined and supple, this is our flagship wine from a vintage defined by elegance and grace – picture a dancer. The 2006 growing season started with a mild spring but finished with an usually dry, hot summer. This led to earlier-than-usual flavor maturity, and while we had hoped for the corresponding lower-than-normal sugar levels as well, the result was actually the development of bright higher tone characters and a beautiful clear fruit profile. A good splash of Merlot adds roundness and silkiness, and the bright fruit lends itself to a smooth, polished mid-palate. These elements make for a pretty, lush wine that is approachable and delicious upon release. The age of the vines, seventy-five percent of which are twenty years or older, contributes to its aging potential. "
208,Abeja Cabernet Sauvignon 2012,,"Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,91,"This is a beautiful, expressive, balanced Cabernet Sauvignon. Blackberry, black cherry, and blueberry, characters come together with nice weight and pretty notes of vanilla bean. Hints of cinnamon stick, dark earth, and pine sap add depth and complexity to a proper amount of fruit. This wine has an extra-silky texture on the palate, with refined tannins. The continuity from the nose to the mouth and all the way through the long finish is exactly what Abeja works so hard to create in all of their wines. It has an ideal combination of acid, tannin, and structure for excellent aging potential."

213,Abeja Merlot 2014,,"Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,90,"This classic varietty is perfectly suited for special growing areas of Washington State, and while it blends beautifully with Cabernet Sauvignon, it has the quality and character to stand firmly on its own. It is a pure, lush, classic Merlot with a special intensity that comes with Washington State fruit."
214,Aberrant Cellars Carpe Noctem Pinot Noir 2011,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",Red Wine,94,"There are some activities which simply seem better suited for when darkness falls and our animal spirits are once again awakened from daytime temperance...in addition to those, savoring this provocative wine should be placed toward the top of the list. As the name of this wine suggests, one can easily get lost in its magnitude[much like the night, itself]- deep, sensuous, structured and carnal, yet graceful enough to walk the high-wire of balance. Sadly, attributes such as these are fleeting and nature will only provide a tiny bounty in which to offer such rare qualities- such is wine as in life. So for those up to the task, carpe diem and then, Carpe Noctem!"
215,Abremundos Uco Valley Octava Bassa Malbec 2014,,"Uco Valley, Mendoza, Argentina",Red Wine,91,"Sensuality that is reminiscent of the richness of the low registers Born of two creators motivated by interlaced passions: Marcelo Pelleriti, winemaker and musician Pedro Aznar, musician and sommelier."

218,Abreu Vineyards Cappella 2010,,"Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,98,"Cappella is one of the oldest vineyard sites in St. Helena. Six acres that sit alongside a Catholic cemetery on the west side of town, it was first planted in 1869. In the 1980s the church asked David to tear out the old vines, then he watched as the land lay fallow for close to two decades. When he finally got the chance to replant, he jumped. He'd tasted fruit from Cappella in the 70s. He knew what kind of wine it could make. But that first replant was ill-fated thanks to diseased rootstock, and once again he was ripping out vines. “It took us six years before we had a crop. We could have ignored it, pulled the vines out one by one as they collapsed. But then we'd have all these different ripening patterns, which would impact consistency. It was an easy decision.”"
219,Abreu Vineyards Howell Mountain 2008,,"Howell Mountain, Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,96,"When David purchased this Howell Mountain property in 2000 it came with an unexpected perk: first growth redwood stakes dating back over a century. Relics of an earlier era of agriculture. “When the college owned this site they'd burn all the underbrush, including the stakes, to keep it clean. When I came in we found them and set them all aside,” he says. At about 2000 feet elevation, Las Posadas sits above the fog line, surrounded by a protected forest of fir and pine. Red Aiken soils are layered over white tufa, and the rocks that littered the site before it was planted now form walls defining the property. The redwood stakes—collected, stacked, preserved—await their next life."
220,Abreu Vineyards Howell Mountain 2009,,"Howell Mountain, Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,98,"As a set of wines, it is hard to surpass the four cuvees from the estate vineyards of David Abreu.

233,Abreu Vineyards Thorevilos 2015,,"Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,97,"Thorevilos was one of David's favorite haunts as a child. There were no vines then. Just pine trees, redwoods, an old olive grove. And a rusted hog wire hanging from a tree—“Hook Man” in Abreu family lore. These days it's the dirt that engrosses him. White tufa that turns to fine powder when you grind it beneath your foot. Tannish soil peppered with orange-brown pebbles. Streaks of dry, red earth.

In addition, aromas of malted milk chocolate, candied violets, and toasted oak fill the nose.  The mouth is just what one would expect from the nose.  Big, sweet, warm, long and delicious.

It 's lively but with full weight throughout the mouth, ending in succulence and renewal for the palate. The tannins are persistent yet not aggressive. We anticipate the supple texture to improve for six years or more and the flavors should become increasingly complex during that time.

237,Acacia Beckstoffer Pinot Noir 2000,,"Carneros, California",Red Wine,88,"The 2000 vintage was moderately warm—certainly warmer than the previous two El Niño vintages. Particularly important is the revailing weather during bloom, as the success of pollination and the seeds that result can indicate the structure of the vintage.

Flavors of ripe tropical fruit, toasted oak, and yeast are suspended within a structure that is rich and lengthy. This is not a delicate wine by any means.

We hand harvested the fruit for our 2005 Carneros Chardonnay, then allowed three hours of skin contact to extract flavors from the skin. A brief period of aeration enabled us to extract those delicious flavors and precipitate out any tannins associated with skin contact. The result is a full-flavored Chardonnay with both concentration and elegance.  Vibrant aromas of crème brûlée, ginger, lemon curd and white peach are followed by a creamy entry which blossoms to a full, sweet, peach, nectarine and citrus mid-palate. Medium-bodied with vibrant acidity, the wine finishes long and full. Our 2005 Chardonnay is perfect with all types of seafood, fish, chicken and pork. "

The time between crushing and pressing is approximately 30 days of which about 10 are of primary fermentation and 20 of extended maceration, during the whole time the temperature is kept around 28-30 Celsius degrees to gain depthand volume in the mouth.

1451,Amuse Bouche Merlot 2007,,"Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,91,"The 2007 harvest was characterized by its split personality. After a moderate summer, a burst of heat in early September led a number of wineries to pick earlier than usual. However, the harvest stalled due to a dramatic cooling off period in mid September. When it resumed later in the month, our vineyards clearly had benefited from the extended hang time. The later harvest allowed an optimal ripening period for our Merlot and Cabernet Franc blocks, which we picked just before heavy rainfall struck the Napa Valley in early October. "

This site experiences warm days, and is protected from winds. This, combined with the cool valley nights, makes the vineyard ideal for slow, even ripening. Syrah tends to thrive given warm days, poor soils and sun and is usually the first harvested. Grenache is notable for its high acidity at harvest adding brightness to the blend.

1477,Anapamu Chardonnay 1999,,"Central Coast, California",White Wine,85,"In order to preserve the sun ripened flavors, the grapes were pressed immediately at the winery, the juice was settled and fed directly into barrels for fermentation.  The minimal handling by not crushing nor destemming the grapes maximizes flavors and minimizes bitter tannins from the skin and seed contact.  The juice slowly fermented over the next five weeks predominantly in un-inoculated yeasts, thus adding complexity.  We used mostly new American and European oak to compliment, but not overwhelm the fruit flavors of the wine.  Malolactic fermentation added further layers of flavor and richness.

It is produced from ancient vines planted in 1889. The Centenaire vineyard is planted to roughly 80% Grenache, 12% Mourvedre and 8% Syrah. The Grenache, which is often picked at 16 degrees potential alcohol, is vinified and aged in tank, while the Mourvedre and Syrah are finished in small barrels for up to 24 months.

With elegance and finesse in mind, the Grenaches grown there produce a low yield. The rest of the fruit comes from Travaillan in the Vaucluse and are grown on a stony soil with lime subsoil and produce a powerful wine. The vineyards are naturally worked with sustainable practice in mind. The blend is 80% Grenache, 10% Syrah and 10% old-vine Cinsault. The wine has aromas and flavors of small red berry fruits, blackcurrant and cherries with slight touch of spices."

1604,Andre Jacquart Mesnil Experience Grand Cru Blanc de Blancs,,"Champagne, France",Sparkling & Champagne,91,"Brilliant pale gold, persistent and fine bead. Smoky minerality reminiscent of Meursault Perrieres. Ethereal fruit, almost as though a food ""foam"" of granny smith apple and a bit of girolle mushroom. Light entry, again, like a fog or cloud, ethereal and light yet so expressive. Almost as though it had intensity of flavor without being wet. Laser-like focus of fruit, precise and defined flavors of Anjou pear, granny smith apple, chanterelles, almost like an infusion or tea of intense flavors with lively, creamy, and exceptionally refined bubbles. Elegant powerful, and yet light, almost dreamlike consistency. Long and longer."
1605,Andrea Oberto Barolo Albarella 2010,,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",Red Wine,92,"Bright red garnet color with light orange shades.

1606,Andrea Oberto Barolo Rocche 2010,,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",Red Wine,95,"Intense ruby-red hue with light garnet reflections. Oaky notes perfectly blending in a flowery, spicy aroma make the wine extremely fine and balanced.

1617,Andretti Merlot 1997,,"Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,89,"Layers of cherries, violets, plums and raspberry jam combine with 16 months in French oak to make a wine that can be enjoyed now or will provide added pleasure after four to six years of additional aging.  "
1618,Andretti Merlot 1999,,"Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,91,"Merlot's increasing popularity over the last few years derives from its fruit intensity and complexity that mimics Cabernet, but remains a much softer and more approachable wine. A rich texture and good body are hallmarks of this varietal and the Merlot from Andretti is characterized by layers of cherries, orange blossoms, plum and raspberry jam. With long aging in French oak, this is a wine that can be enjoyed now or will provide added pleasure with four to six years of additional aging."
1619,Andretti Sauvignon Blanc 2001,,"Napa Valley, California",White Wine,90,"This delightful wine combines the complexity of fresh fruit with a light, crisp feel to create a wine that can be enjoyed by itself, but is also wonderful with food. It has floral, tropical overtones, leaning more towards pineapple than overt herbaceous qualities. While the majority of the wine is fermented in stainless steel to preserve the crisp character, a portion is aged in oak barrels to add a measure of complexity that sets it apart from other Sauvignon Blancs."
1620,Andrew Hardy Little Ox Shiraz 2005,,"McLaren Vale, South Australia, Australia",Red Wine,93,"A big, ripe fruit spicy McLaren Vale Shiraz.

A soft, but weighty traditional McLaren Vale Shiraz."
1621,Andrew Hardy Little Ox Shiraz 2006,,"McLaren Vale, South Australia, Australia",Red Wine,90,"The Little Ox is named after wine maker, owner Andrew Hardy, of Hardy family fame. Around 650 cases were made, so based on the previous review of the 2005 and the quality of this, the current 2006 release, it's quite simple, get it while you can. Dense and richly fruited, but light on its feet in relationship to its concentration, this is endowed with finer grained almost powdery tannins and is loaded up with a combination of both red and blue fruit on its medium fuller, fuller frame. Juicy, but dry, with some chewy density on the finish, this is still quite primary and evolving, but everything is in place for big reviews again. Hopefully there will be some around when the tallies come forth. The smart money will place their bets now."

1624,Andrew Januik Stone Cairn Cabernet Sauvignon 2013,,"Red Mountain, Yakima Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,90,"This beautiful violet colored wine delivers a variety of complex aromas including candied cherries, currants, and chocolate. The front of the palate shows nice sweetness and fruit which transitions into a well-structured mid-palate that displays more earthiness as well as the subtle notes of new French oak.

1627,Andrew Murray Camp Four RGB 2012,,"Santa Ynez Valley, Santa Barbara, Central Coast, California",White Wine,90,"The RGB is named for the blend of Roussanne and Grenache Blanc, which is a typical white wine blend found  in and around the small villages in the south of France.  Typically Roussanne, which is more difficult to ripen and thus more rare, takes a backseat to the Grenache Blanc, which is a more neutral tasting grape.  We like to richen up this blend a bit and include more of the robust Roussanne.  The resulting blend is nearly a 50-50 balance between the two varieties.  The grapes were whole cluster pressed and then fermented and aged together in a small, temperature controlled stainless tank.  This early blending allowed the flavors to come together more completely.  After fermentation, the wine was transferred to neutral French Burgundy barrels to allow a bit more oxygen into the wine, which acted to soften and round out the final wine.  The aroma of this wine explodes with white flowers, green apple, a tropical/banana note, and a flinty/minerally note.  The aromas find their way onto the palate where you will sense a long, round, viscous mouthfeel made complex with a racy acidity.  The RGB is clean, fresh, and ready to drink.  It should, however, improve over the next couple of years.  "
1628,Andrew Murray Enchante 2016,,"Santa Ynez Valley, Santa Barbara, Central Coast, California",White Wine,90,"The French say “Enchanté” when they greet each other. Andrew Murray has named their Estate-Grown, signature white blend of Grenache Blanc and Roussanne after this expression. These two varieties are truly yin and yang. Roussanne is rich and unctuous, while Grenache Blanc is bright and racy. The two complement each other perfectly! The winery fermented and aged this wine in older French Oak barrels, which lends a beautifully smooth texture to this dry white wine. "
1629,Andrew Murray Esperance Red Blend 2012,,California,Red Wine,91,"This rich red is a blend of 60% Grenache, 25% Syrah and 15% Mourvedre.  It was given a more serious winemaking regimen with a bit more new oak. I also chose a ""bigger"" Syrah to blend in with the Grenache and Mourvedre, so the resulting wine is a bit more ""profound"". I think that it is perhaps the best Espérance that we have ever released. All of the extra work yields a rich, concentrated wine with aromas and flavors of ultra-ripe strawberries, black cherries, and blueberries, mixed in with the spiciness of cinnamon and vanilla from the toasty new French Oak.    "
1630,Andrew Murray Esperance Red Blend 2014,,"Central Coast, California",Red Wine,91,"We named this wine in homage of a wonderful restaurant and inn in Vezelay, named L'Esperance. We used the inn as a home-base for much of our early explorations into the Rhône Valley and fell in love with the wines of the southern Rhône region. "
1631,Andrew Murray Esperance Rose 2016,,"Santa Ynez Valley, Santa Barbara, Central Coast, California",Pink and Rosé,91,"The wine is wonderfully light, yet complex, and full of personality. There are plenty of fruity notes, but this is definitely not a kool-aid Rose of yesteryear from California. Rather, it is very much in the moment. Dry, light, very refreshing. This should be your go to wine this summer!"
1632,Andrew Murray Roasted Slope Syrah 2001,,"Central Coast, California",Red Wine,90,"Thus the wine is a blend of Syrah and Viognier that was picked and fermented together. ""Roasted Slope"" is the direct translation of ""Cote Rotie"", one of the most famous vineyards in all of France, where Syrah and Viognier are allowed/encouraged to grow together in the same vineyards. We craft our wine with the same winemaking regime that the French use to craft their wines. The co-fermentation of the Viognier with the Syrah yields a wine that is slightly softer and smoother for its young age, with the wonderful perfumed highlights of Viognier in the nose. The Viognier also, brings out the elusive candied-violets aroma in Syrah. This is a very rich and full-bodied Syrah that is so fun to drink right now; however do not be fooled, this wine will age for years to come."
1633,Andrew Murray Roasted Slope Syrah 2014,,"Santa Barbara, Central Coast, California",Red Wine,92,"I have been attempting to recreate those flavors ever since, but have always come up short...until now. I am crazy proud to release the new and improved Roasted Slope, a blend of co-fermented Syrah and Viognier, all from three vineyard blocks along Alisos Canyon Road.

1636,Andrew Murray Tous les Jours Syrah 2008,,"Central Coast, California",Red Wine,91,"We refer to our ""everyday"" and easy-drinking Syrah as ""Tous les Jours."" A red wine blend of Syrah from Paso Robles and Santa Ynez Valley vineyards, it is carefully blended to produce a soft, smooth Syrah full of ripe berry aromas and flavors. Tous les Jours is consistently lauded as a 'Crozes-Hermitage look-alike' by wine critics and has been touted as one of the best wines under $20."
1637,Andrew Murray Tous les Jours Syrah 2011,,"Central Coast, California",Red Wine,92,"The Syrah Tous les Jours is a quintisential Santa Ynez Valley Syrah. It is simultaneously bold and balanced, rich and smooth, fruit forward and earthy. It is impossibly dark and full-bodied, without ever going over the top. It is heavily inspired by Northern Rhone Syrah (Hermitage) and Australian Shiraz (Borassa Valley). The aromas and flavors are dominated by black cherry, raspberry, white pepper, forrest floor and toasty oak. It is absolutely unique and special expression of Syrah. Moreover, It is a style that one can enjoy every day."
1638,Andrew Murray Tous les Jours Syrah 2012,,"Central Coast, California",Red Wine,90,"The 2012 vintage of the Tous les Jours Syrah is remarkably dark and full-bodied, and yet it has such gentle tannins. It is truly a pleasure to drink, especially at the price. Lots of fruit and spices here...no need to wax poetic about this one as it tastes just plain yummy."
1639,Andrew Murray Tous les Jours Syrah 2014,,"Santa Ynez Valley, Santa Barbara, Central Coast, California",Red Wine,92,"Andrew Murray strives to craft a quintessentially Santa Ynez Valley Syrah, where we have the ability to show both the cool and warm climate characteristics of Syrah."

It is simultaneously bold and balanced, rich and smooth, fruit forward and frothy. It is impossibly dark and full-bodied, without ever going over the top. It is heavily inspired by Northern Rhone Syrah (Hermitage) and Australian Shiraz (Barossa Valley). The aromas and flavors are dominated by black cherry, raspberry, white pepper, forest floor and toasty oak. It is an absolutely unique and special expression of Syrah. Moreover, It is a style that one can enjoy every day."

1643,Andrew Murray Watch Hill Syrah 2009,,"Central Coast, California",Red Wine,93,"We added 5% Viognier to this vintage in hommage of our old Roasted Slope Syrah.  The 2009 vintage just begged for a little something extra, and the Viognier delivered by lifting the nose and by helping to keep this Syrah remain yummy and dinstinctive.  The aromas and flavors lean toward bright red fruits...cherries, raspberries, currants, and cranberries, with just a touch of a floral/violet note (from the Viognier) with a spicy note dominated by fresh black pepper and a dose of sweet French oak. This wine is quite quaffable now, but you will be rewarded if you wait 2-7 years to drink this one. "
1644,Andrew Rich Cabernet Franc 2007,,"Yakima Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,92,"We are now sourcing our Franc from the famed Red Willow Vineyard near Yakima. This block was planted in 1989 on a rocky east-facing slope, where the poor, well-drained soil (not to mention Mike Sauer and his sons and crew) helps control vigor and yields. Rich and powerful, the wine can be drunk now with decanting, but a year in the bottle should work wonders."
1645,Andrew Rich Croft Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc 2017,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",White Wine,90,"Super-refreshing lime meets hints of grapefruit and gooseberry, with a palate that builds weight. Add to that a clean finish with a subtle stony character and you have a prime summer white."
1646,Andrew Rich Croft Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc 2018,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",White Wine,90,"Passionfruit, guava and gooseberry pop from the glass, with an underpinning of flinty smoke. The Croft SB is filled with ripe fruit, and is equally tamed by the bright acid we've come to associated with the Croft site. Extended lees contact give an unusual textural richness to what otherwise might seem a light bodied wine. Perhaps our best bottling thus far, and should age well for the next 5 to 8 years."
1647,Andrew Rich Cuvee B Pinot Noir 2008,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",Red Wine,90,"With its darker color and deep aromas of graphite, crushed red and black berries, and a hint of wild herbs, the Cuvée announces itself as a wine that is altogether more ""serious"" than the Prelude.  (And for those who have been following this wine for the last 10 vintages, it should be noted that with this vintage the B has been promoted: it is no longer our ""entry-level"" Pinot, though in order to attain an elevated rank it was necessary to bottle much less than previously—about one-half of normal.)  In the mouth the wine seems more savory than overtly fruity, with a round, sweet, rich mid-palate.  It is full and lush with any excess weight (a hallmark of 2008).  There is excellent length here, with well-integrated tannins and vibrant acidity to keep the wine focused and fresh.  Delicious now, this will go five years at least. "
1648,Andrew Rich Prelude Pinot Noir 2010,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",Red Wine,91,"A clean, bright nose of cherries and floral notes adds a suggestion of sweetness with air.  This initially seems round and soft, becoming lively and energetic on the back end, with modest tannins and good acidity.  Although designed to give immediate pleasure, this Prelude has the framework to age for several years."
1649,Andrew Rich Verbatim Pinot Noir 2013,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",Red Wine,90,"Andrew Rich's first Pinot to be released from a two-faced vintage. They went into harvest strategizing on how to handle a hot dry year, but when five inches of rain fell over four days in late September, their plans went out the window. Nonetheless, when farming was meticulous and sorting was ruthless, what resulted were Pinots that are indisputably ripe in character, but on a lighter frame, with vibrant acidity, moderate alcohol, and soft tannins."
1650,Andrew Will Winery Cabernet Franc 2016,,"Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,91,"We believe in wines that are true to their varietals and this wine is classic Cabernet Franc. It exhibits kitchen herbal flavors on the nose which assert themselves on the palate. Additional fresh forest floor notes as well as plum, dark currant and huckleberry fruit notes. A lift on the finish from subdued acids. "
1651,Andrew Will Winery Champoux Red 2000,,"Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,90,"Red licorice, plums and dark cherries are found in the aromatic profile of this wine. A blend of 68% Cabernet Sauvignon, 18% Cabernet Franc, 10% Merlot, and 4% Petit Verdot, it is medium to full-bodied, concentrated, and deep. Its complex, intense, and powerful core reveals flavors of blackberries, cassis, licorice, and road tar. Loaded with tannin, this structured effort also displays a long, highly expressive finish."
1652,Andrew Will Winery Champoux Vineyard Horse Heaven Hills 1999,,"Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,95,"Champoux is a comple wine, having not only primary fruit flavors, but also components of flora and earth as well as mineral aspects. Each year since we have been making this wine we have enjoyed watching its journey as it changes in bottle. We are expecting more and more from the vineyard and feel that we are being rewarded for our demands from it."
1653,Andrew Will Winery Champoux Vineyard Horse Heaven Hills 2001,,"Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,91,"Champoux is showing itself to be complex, having not only primary fruit flavors, but also components of flora and earth as well as mineral aspects. Each year since we have been making this wine we have enjoyed watching its journey as it changes in bottle. We are expecting more and more from the vineyard and feel that we are being rewarded for our demands from it."
1654,Andrew Will Winery Champoux Vineyard Horse Heaven Hills 2004,,"Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,93,"Blend: 44% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Cabernet Franc, 22% Merlot, 9% Petit Verdot "
1655,Andrew Will Winery Champoux Vineyard Horse Heaven Hills 2007,,"Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,92,This vintage is composed of more than half Cabernet Franc. The unctuous almost liquid cascade of flavors that first come to mind are greatly colored by this grape. The mid palate is thick and rich with a compelling balance and flow to the palate. At this period this is compelling wine which is at once a wine to drink after being open for a few hours or one to put away for a decade or more. 
1656,Andrew Will Winery Champoux Vineyard Horse Heaven Hills 2006,,"Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,92,"A lot of people have been whispering that this isthe finest vineyard in Washington, and while weare always interested in what is being said inwhispers and behind closed doors we can't always give as much of our trust to these thoughts as some. Nevertheless we are ready to agree on the terrific sense of body and pronounced strength of the fruit in the wines being made from the various part of Champoux Vineyard. As much as I fall in love with the wines from Champoux, I have to pull myself back and wait for a few years until the true voicing and pitch of these wines comes forward. Again, it is the beauty and compelling nature of this wine as a whole which draws me to it in an almost narcotic way."
1657,Andrew Will Winery Champoux Vineyard Horse Heaven Hills 2008,,"Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,93,"Although this wine has much more Cabernet Sauvignon than the 2007, the wines seem to be more like sisters than cousins. The 2008 stands not in the shadows of 2007 as I had first thought it might but right next to it. It is a wine that although different in structure, nevertheless possesses all that it needs to satisfy now and in the future. "
1658,Andrew Will Winery Champoux Vineyard Horse Heaven Hills 2009,,"Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,91,"This wine has a full middle palate with layers of raspberry, black cherry, and plum with blueberry reflections. The wine is soft considering the percentage of cabernet and has good acidity that contributes to its freshness and structure.  "
1659,Andrew Will Winery Champoux Vineyard Horse Heaven Hills 2010,,"Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,93,"The texture this wine possesses carries through from start to finish. This is a forceful wine with power and grace from the Cabernet Franc. The Merlot in the wine adds fruit and a wonderful sense on the palate of freshness and red berries. Cabernet Sauvignon serves to knit the wine into a whole and provides, along with the other varieties, a wonderful lattice like structure that allows for the other flavors in the wine to present themselves. Very good nose for a wine so young. "
1660,Andrew Will Winery Champoux Vineyard Horse Heaven Hills 2012,,"Horse Heaven Hills, Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,91,"This beautifully refined wine is very pure and nicely ripe on both the nose and the palate. The black current, sweet dark berries, tobacco leaf, and stony soil characteristics are accompanied by hints of floral notes. Full bodied, this wine is seamless in texture with fine-grained tannins, noticeable grip, and a long memorable finish. It is a superb example what this vineyard and AVA can deliver."
1661,Andrew Will Winery Champoux Vineyard Horse Heaven Hills 2013,,"Horse Heaven Hills, Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,92,This medium to full-bodied wine exhibits the energy and freshness that are the hallmarks of these 2013 vintage wines.
1662,Andrew Will Winery Champoux Vineyard Horse Heaven Hills 2014,,"Horse Heaven Hills, Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,92,"A combination of dark fruit intermingles with notes of cassis, mocha and wildflowers. This wine has a rich and smooth mouthfeel that exhibits fine-grained tannins while still maintaining a sense of lift and freshness."
1663,Andrew Will Winery Champoux Vineyard Red 2001,,"Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,93,"Red licorice, plums and dark cherries are found in the aromatic profile of this wine. A blend of 68% Cabernet Sauvignon, 18% Cabernet Franc, 10% Merlot, and 4% Petit Verdot, it is medium to full-bodied, concentrated, and deep. Its complex, intense, and powerful core reveals flavors of blackberries, cassis, licorice, and road tar. Loaded with tannin, this structured effort also displays a long, highly expressive finish."
1664,Andrew Will Winery Ciel du Cheval 2000,,"Yakima Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,91,"Fresh, big, and ripe, with aromas of Italian herbs and bing cherries.  A full-bodied wine, but very silky and smooth, with great structure."
1665,Andrew Will Winery Ciel du Cheval 2002,,"Yakima Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,92,"The wine has a long finish, a sense of breeding, great fruit character and presence on the palate. The winery always loves Ciel Du Cheval and while each vintage differs (something they love even more) and has its own unique and usually worthy identity, this year stands out a bit more than usual. Each year of age these vines gain, adds immeasurably to the wine and makes it just that much easier to produce wine which they hope will be memorable. "
1666,Andrew Will Winery Ciel du Cheval 2006,,"Yakima Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,92,"A blend of 19% Cabernet Sauvignon, 37% Cabernet Franc, 40% Merlot and 4% Petit Verdot."
1667,Andrew Will Winery Ciel du Cheval 2004,,"Yakima Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,91,The nose is a lovely blend of earth and fruit and is quite forward for such a young wine. The wine is medium bodied offset by depth and a sense of promise. This is a stalwart wine with well defined delicate shading. The fruit profile is red fruit with floral aromas mixed with a kind of earthy spiciness. 
1668,Andrew Will Winery Ciel du Cheval 2007,,"Yakima Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,92,"The balance between fruit and structure is well played out in this vintage. The classic and austere qualities that this vineyard has each year are well drawn out. As with most American wines, this wine projects more fruit in its youth than its European reflections. Over time we will see this difference shrink as the wines move (hopefully) into more complex incarnations of themselves. We would like to see this wine well stored for three or four years. As is almost always true with Andrew Will wines you can enjoy them now, but they will provide greater complexity over time."
1669,Andrew Will Winery Ciel du Cheval 2008,,"Yakima Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,92,"This wine is currently the front runner in this release. The blend of structure, power and depth made the wine the favorite in a recent tasting of ten vintages of Ciel du Cheval (the much maligned 2000 vintage was second... so much for ideology). The wine is immediately expressive as well as fully in control of the austerity this vineyard always shows.  "
1670,Andrew Will Winery Ciel du Cheval 2009,,"Yakima Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,93,"The wine has a mature ripeness that deftly balances its red fruit palate of red currant, plum, cherry, and loganberry.  It is a harmonious wine with ripe and generous qualities in the fruit that do not overwhelm the structure due to its fresh acidity. "
1671,Andrew Will Winery Ciel du Cheval 2010,,"Yakima Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,91,The winemakers of Andrew Will have put no Cabernet Sauvignon into this blend. They have for a few years wanted to make a wine solely from Merlot and Cabernet Franc from Ciel du Cheval. They picked the right year to try as the two varieties I chose are strong in the 2010 vintage. A really finely set structure is aided by the transparent and yet deeply flavored fruit present in the 2010 vintage from this vineyard. Followers of the property will know that a refined and laudatory austerity is one of the hallmarks of the vineyard. Leaving out the Cabernet Sauvignon has brought the vintage into perfect tune. 
1672,Andrew Will Winery Ciel du Cheval 2011,,"Yakima Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,91,"Like the previous vintage, the Ciel does not possess any Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend. The wine exhibits hints of damson plum skin, smoke, cardamom and cinnamon. As the wine opens up a secondary layer of minerality reminiscent of river stones emerges. There is a light sense of earth combined with a spiciness that lends itself to a very complex mid palate. The bright, yet focused tannins create a approachable wine that will only become more complex with time. "
1673,Andrew Will Winery Ciel du Cheval 2012,,"Yakima Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,90,"This wine has concentration, structure and is rich in mineral, graphite and dark fruit notes. A top site in Washington State, Andrew Will has been sourcing from this vineyard since its beginning in 1989. "
1674,Andrew Will Winery Ciel du Cheval 2013,,"Yakima Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,91,"This red blend of Merlot and Cabernet Franc once again revisits the idea of creating a wine from Ciel du Cheval that doesn’t use Cabernet Sauvignon. This wine shows off an intriguing combination of red berries, plums, espresso, and river rocks on the nose. "
1675,Andrew Will Winery Columbia Valley Cabernet Sauvignon 2014,,"Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,90,The fruit comes from the Champoux Vineyard which has been acclaimed as the best site for Cabernet Sauvignon in Washington.  Notes of violets and licorice with a depth of flavors on the palate while fresh and lively.  Finishes with silky tannins and length.
1676,Andrew Will Winery Columbia Valley Cabernet Sauvignon 2016,,"Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,92,"This wine bucks the trend toward heavy, overbearing Cabernet Sauvignon that too often shuts down on the palate. Instead, this wine has texture and fruit bound by tannin and acid to perform in glass and on the palate. It is seductive in its freshness and fruit definition."
1677,Andrew Will Winery May's Discovery Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon 2012,,"Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,90,"The nose is perfumed, rich black raspberry and plums, graphite notes, and cedary wood.  On the palate the wine is deep, full- bodied and complex, with a fine core of fruit, ripe, chewy tannins, good acids and outstanding length and grip on the focused and youthful finish. This is an excellent representation of the high quality Cabernet Sauvignon coming out of Washington State."
1678,Andrew Will Winery May's Discovery Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon 2013,,"Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,91,"100% Cabernet from this young vineyard which sits on a hillside bench overlooking the Columbia River. The nose is perfumed, rich black raspberry and plums, graphite notes, and cedary wood.  On the palate the wine is deep, full- bodied and complex, with a fine core of fruit, ripe, chewy tannins, good acids and outstanding length and grip on the focused and youthful finish. This is an excellent representation of the high quality Cabernet Sauvignon coming out of Washington State."
1679,Andrew Will Winery Merlot 2016,,"Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,92,"A buoyant and appealing wine, the 2016 Columbia Valley Merlot offers up ripe fruit balanced with tannin and acid. It has a well-defined middle palate and a lasting finish, particularly after being opened for some time. Well-knit and full in the mouth. The fruit comes from the Two Blondes and Champoux Vineyards. The 2016 vintage was an easy growing season which resulted in high yields. "
1680,Andrew Will Winery Sorella 1998,,"Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,91,"Dark ruby color.  Ripe and big, loaded with luscious raspberry, plum, spices, and violets, with a touch of sweet oak.  Satin tannins, great structure.  Amazing wine."
1681,Andrew Will Winery Sorella 2003,,"Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,90,"Andrew Will has struggled verbally and enologically to define their wines and those around them. They have argued for balance in the bottle and exacting viticulture in the vineyard to yield even ripeness. Yet wines, which move to the center of the international style, continue to be the light in the eyes of some. "
1682,Andrew Will Winery Sorella 2005,,"Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,94,"This 2005 vintage of Sorella is a blend of 65% Block I and II Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Merlot, 17% Cabernet Franc, and 6% Petit Verdot grown from vines with an average age of 29 years. "
1683,Andrew Will Winery Sorella 2006,,"Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,93,"The promise, complex fruit, and mineral qualities already apparent in this wine are easily seen after the wine has been open for a few hours. Most of the wines when young show much better after they have been open for four to eight hours. This wine is no exception. My partner in the Two Blondes vineyard who knows my wines better than I says this is the best wine made at Andrew Will, and while I don't put much belief in the idea of ""best"" wine, I am very happy with the path this wine is taking. We like it now but think 4 to 25 years in the cellar. "
1684,Andrew Will Winery Sorella 2007,,"Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,93,The complex display of mineral and fruit notes puts this wine into play as one with terrific promise. This wine is a dominant expression of Cabernet Sauvignon which exhibits itself in a light made brighter by the addition of Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Already it is starting to move out of its first stage into something more formed and giving. We like the persistently bright personality of this vintage of Sorella as well as its ability to cast a shadow into the future. 
1685,Andrew Will Winery Sorella 2009,,"Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,92,"This wine has a full, beautiful nose with massive structure. There are mineral-like qualities in both the nose and finish, along with scents of deep, recessive fruit and licorice that deliver fully on the palate. The wine's intensity and elegance is highlighted by its rich layering of sweetness and silky tannins. "
1686,Andrew Will Winery Sorella 2010,,"Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,91,The dominance of Cabernet Sauvignon in this year's Sorella is brought upwards with the addition of Merlot and some Cabernet Franc. The base of Cabernet is in itself a great starting place but once the other varieties are added the fruit is put into balance and forcefully shows its varietal character.  This wine says more through a sense of quiet and poise. 
1687,Andrew Will Winery Sorella 2012,,"Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,93,"The gorgeously nose shows a blend of cassis, graphite, river stones, tobacco leaf with hints of black currants and dark rasberry. The palate shows a superb full-bodied, balanced, structured wine that integrates a combination of smooth tannins and bright acids. It finishes with excellent length and grip, on the pure and complex finish. "
1688,Andrew Will Winery Sorella 2013,,"Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,92,"This Cabernet Sauvignon dominant red blend shows how Champoux Vineyard continues to produce some of the highest quality fruit in Washington State. This full-bodied wine offers up a bouquet of cassis, dark fruit and graphite. On the palate the wine shows of well-integrated tannins, bright acids leading to a long and memorable finish. Once again the 2013 vintage shows us why Sorella is our flagship wine."
1689,Andrew Will Winery Sorella (375ML half-bottle) 2011,,"Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,90,"The Sorella is an attractive balance of rich tannins, bright acids, and flavors. On the nose hints of limestone, anise, lavender, blueberries and violet are accompanied by generous and deep fruit qualities. The mid palate is possessed of textured tannins in harmony with a complex depth. The wine has a laser-like focus and shows elegant restraint from both start to finish. The bold sophistication of Champoux fruit is fulfilled by the complexities of the wine."
1690,Andrew Will Winery Two Blondes Vineyard Red 2006,,"Yakima Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,92,"This precocious vineyard is finally showing strengthand a youthful complexity that I much admire in otherwines. I like its assertive nose and exuberant body aswell as the clean finish. The wine has much CabernetFranc in it yet seems to have that herbal and mineralside to it that I look for in the wines I taste and buy. Iwas not sure how this vineyard would go but with allthe patience of a saint, Chris Hoon the vineyardmanager, has brought to Andrew Will a truly complexand well ripened fruit. We continue to work row by rowwith this area and we are hopeful that in a few years thegrowing reputation which this much maligned part ofWashington has had in the past will morph into a trulycompelling area for growing Merlot, Cabernet FranceCabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, and Petite Verdot."
1691,Andrew Will Winery Two Blondes Vineyard Red 2007,,"Yakima Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,90,"This vintage is by far the best we have gotten from this vineyard. The work that we have done there with trellising, soil, water, and clonal selections is now bringing it even with the other vineyards from whom we source. The identity is fully apparent in this vintage through its soft texture and very full mid-palate. The depth of flavor reveals much about this vintage and those we hope to see in the future from Two Blondes. A lot of the work we have done here has been on an almost row-by-row basis as we sought to increase the root structure of the vines. "
1692,Andrew Will Winery Two Blondes Vineyard Red 2008,,"Yakima Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,91,"The middle palate is full and soft with sophisticated fruit from the Angle Block section of the vineyard. The fruit is fully focused in a way which allows opinions to be drawn, as well as a call for patience with this wine. The vineyard is starting to show its pedigree more assertively as each year strengthens the plantings. My thanks go out to all the work Chris Hoon has done at this vineyard. "
1693,Andrew Will Winery Two Blondes Vineyard Red 2009,,"Yakima Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,91,"This is a soft and supple, almost lyrical wine with great acidity. There are hints of black fruit qualities on the finish, which are highlighted by more herbal and citrus freshness in the middle palate. The sophistication on the nose lifts the wine's complexity with its perfume-based bouquet. "
1694,Andrew Will Winery Two Blondes Vineyard Red 2010,,"Yakima Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,91,"This wine is true to the vintage and the vineyard it comes from. The focused and yet soft middle palate is at once indicative of the vintage and the vineyard's characteristics. The fruit is bright and yet giving. The middle structure of this wine is softly set and so allows for a great deal of immediate pleasure as well as an authentic promise of complexity to come should the wine be stored.  We like it now, if opened for a few hours, with a great variety of food including seafood with almost anything but a cream sauce. Perfect as it is with those foods, it is able to add much to a variety of meats. Anything with a fruit based sauce or smoke is greatly enhanced by the savory kitchen herbal facets of the wine as well as a black fruit profile. Nice wine."
1695,Andrew Will Winery Two Blondes Vineyard Red 2011,,"Yakima Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,91,"The wine possesses extraordinary aromatics and alluring fragrances. Notes of kitchen herbs, cassis, and light forest qualities are quickly perceived. The soft, middle palate is supported by sophisticated, complex fruit. Tobacco also comes to mind as a compliment to the underlying red and black fruit. The wine is fresh and lively with balanced tannins and restraint on the finish. "
1696,Andrew Will Winery Two Blondes Vineyard Red 2012,,"Yakima Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,90,"This medium-full bodied wine is 50% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Cabernet Franc. This cooler sited vineyard with clay soils atop basalt bedrock provides standout Merlot and Cabernet Franc, in particular.  The bouquet is outstanding, bringing to mind black plums, dark currants, coffee, a touch of menthol, cigar smoke, and fresh herbs. The palate features a stunning combination of complexity, structure and balance that finishes with a tangy, energetic lengthiness."
1697,Andrew Will Winery Two Blondes Vineyard Red 2013,,"Yakima Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,91, Two Blondes is Andrew Will Winery's estate vineyard and is in the Yakima Valley AVA.
1698,Angel Camp Anderson Valley Estate Pinot Noir 2013,,"Anderson Valley, Mendocino, California",Red Wine,90,"The Estate Pinot Noir is full-bodied and voluptuous, with a core of black cherry and plum. The Swan and David Bruce selections add intense ""blue"" fruits and complexity to the mouth feel, while the Dijon 667 lends structure and soft tannins. The oak tempers the naturally bright acidity creating a balanced quality on the palate."
1699,Angel Rodriguez Vidal Martinsancho Rueda Verdejo 2010,,"Rueda, Spain",White Wine,90,"From free-run juice, the new wine is racked into large, centuries-old subterranean oak vessels prior to clarification and bottling. A highly extractive, herbaceous and minerally-complex Verdejo with excellent aging capacity and a perennial hallmark wine for the region.  "
1700,Angela Estate Abbott Claim Pinot Noir 2012,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",Red Wine,94,"The site of a portion of the original John F. Abbott Donation Land Claim awarded on May 27, 1860.  This 16-acre vineyard was planted in 2001 with Pinot Noir clones:  Pommard, 777 and 115, on ancient Marine Sedimentary soils that were once ancient ocean bed. This wine is lush and plush, displaying rich fruit and deeply intense color with complex savory truffle notes. Flavors of red current, cherry cola, ripe raspberry, sweet pipe tobacco, rose petal make this a more collegiate compliment to our Angela Estate pinot noir."
1701,Angela Estate Abbott Claim Pinot Noir 2013,,"Yamhill-Carlton District, Willamette Valley, Oregon",Red Wine,91,"The 2013 Abbott Claim Pinot Noir has silky tannins, flavors of ripe red currant and raspberry, cherry cola, sassafrass.  Rich mushroom and white truffle aromas and an overlay of sassafrass and sweet cedar or pipe tobacco."
1702,Angela Estate Angela Vineyard Pinot Noir 2013,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",Red Wine,90,"The 2013 vintage was an interesting one for the Willamette Valley.  Many vineyards had deluges of rain before harvest. Thankfully, that was not the case with our 2013 offering. The placement of the flagship vineyard, Angela Estate lies within the rain shadow and harvests rather early. Made by legendary winemaker, Ken Wright the wine exhibits all of the beautiful floral and spice elements we typically see from this site; rose petal, hibiscus, root beer and cherry cola, mouth-filling juicy red raspberry and a seamless white pepper finish. 2013 Angela is a little more juicy than the 2012 with delightful, floral and umami aromas. Angela vineyard was planted in 2006 on ancient marine sedimentary soils with Wadenswil, Dijon 777 & 115. "
1703,Angela Estate Angela Vineyard Pinot Noir 2014,,"Yamhill-Carlton District, Willamette Valley, Oregon",Red Wine,91,"An early vintage, with ideal conditions and big yields for all of the Willamette Valley. The 2014 vintage shows a clean, pale ruby/garnet color. The wine displays a good intensity, with developing aromas of rose petal, cedar shavings, bay leaf, black currant and cranberry. Can be enjoyed now and has potential for aging."
1704,Angeline California Pinot Noir 2016,,California,Red Wine,89,"This wine is no exception to Angeline's dedication in over-delivering quality in every bottle of wine. The California Pinot Noir is a wealth of aromas such as fresh cranberries, maraschino cherries, and orange zest. The palate is round and juicy with lively acidity, and a touch of sweet, toasty oak on the finish."
1705,Angeline Reserve Chardonnay 2018,,"Monterey, Central Coast, California",White Wine,89,"This Chardonnay has a delicious bouquet of ripe golden pear, tropical pineapple, and sweet honeydew melon, along with aromatic apple blossom, and creamy vanilla bean. The carefully chosen, lightly impactful French oak serves to convey a perceived sweetness that is perfectly balanced by the clean acidity around the edges of the palate. Although deceivingly full bodied, the wine maintains a juicy mouthfeel and a clean, concise finish."
1706,Angeline Reserve Merlot 2015,,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California",Red Wine,88,"Another great ambassador of the Paso Robles diverse and increasingly respected region, this wine opens with aromas of ripened blackberries, maraschino cherries, and jammy blueberry notes, while the palate balances out with hints of fresh coffee beans and a dark caramel finish. Invitingly fruit-forward with a medium body that is well structured with unobtrusive tannins."
1707,Angeline Reserve Pinot Noir 2015,,California,Red Wine,90,"This dense, sophisticated Pinot Noir boastfully over-delivers aromas of fresh strawberries, wild raspberries, and spicy cherry cola. The smooth, resolved palate has a clean, well-balanced acidity that ties up neatly with an understated creamy, caramel finish."
1708,Angeline Reserve Pinot Noir 2016,,"Mendocino, California",Red Wine,91,"Angeline takes great pride in crafting wines that truly represent their varietals and appellations, and 2016 made this goal easily acheivable. This dense, sophisticated Pinot Noir boastfully over-delivers aromas of fresh strawberries, wild raspberries, and spicy cherry cola. The bold, yet resolved palate has a clean, well-balanced acidity that ties up neatly with a complementary cream and caramel finish."
1709,Angeline Reserve Sauvignon Blanc 2017,,"Sonoma County, California",White Wine,90,"With fresh tropical aromas of passionfruit and guava, followed by juicy green apple, gooseberry, and zesty citrus zest this wine is layered with a definitive minerality and subtle savory notes of lemongrass. An easy drinker with a round creamy palate, balanced by a bright acidity and a lingering ripened fruit finish."
1710,Angeline Rose of Pinot Noir 2016,,California,Pink and Rosé,88,"This mouthwatering Rosé will be certain to exceed expectations. With delicious aromas of watermelon, nectarine, and ruby red grapefruit, complemented by floral notes of lilies and orange blossoms, we challenge you not to be delighted. A fruity, sweet front palate of candied strawberries, leads into a crisp, citrus mid, and closes beautifully with a clean, concise acidity on the end. This is destined to be a versatile crowd pleaser."
1711,Angeline Sauvignon Blanc 2008,,"Russian River, Sonoma County, California",White Wine,90,"The 2008 harvest started off a bit challenging, but produced beautiful fruit all the same. The year began with unexpected last frost, heat spikes and unseasonable rain. However, the end of spring and all through summer provided idyllic conditions that remained around 80 degrees with dry weather and few heat spikes. Lower yields allowed intense, superb fruit to develop.  "
1712,Angeline Sauvignon Blanc 2012,,"Russian River, Sonoma County, California",White Wine,89,"Angeline 2012 Russian River Valley Sauvignon Blanc is produced from three different Russian River Valley vineyards: Dempel, Herrick and Ricioli. The Russian River Valley is known for a coastal influence that often brings fog to the area. One vineyard is located in a slightly warmer part of the appellation which offers rich, ripe fruit character. The other vineyard is in a cooler area which brings nice acidity and a really intense varietal character to the wine.  "
1713,Angeline Sauvignon Blanc 2014,,"Russian River, Sonoma County, California",White Wine,90,"This wine presents itself as the perfect canvas for showcasing the full potential of a Russian River Sauvignon Blanc. The drinker is greeted immediately with aromas of Meyer lemon zest and pink grapefruit with an underlying sweet, creaminess reminiscent of freesias.

1840,Anthonij Rupert Optima 2012,,"Franschhoek Valley, South Africa",Red Wine,90,"Beautiful seductive interplay of spice and red and black berry fruits on both the nose and palate.

The two wines were distinct, but they were playing in the same key. This year, the differences between the two are dramatic. Botanica is lavishly red fruited and dramatically rich. Its complexity comes more from ethereal floral tendencies than from mineral and earth.  Antica Terra displays the richness of the vintage, but it is paler, detailed and more concise. Its flavors are from the forest: small wild berries, chanterelles, yellow leaves. This wine includes more fruit from our estate and two extreme sites closer to the coast. In 2009 the stems from these sites ripened to become russet, dense and woody. The impressions of spice, woodlands and autumn come from this.  "

Our fears of splitting and mold were replaced by raisining and shriveling.

There are notes of ripe guava, red Anjou pear, Meyer lemon, and lightly toasted brioche, finishing with notes of honeysuckle and lemon curd. This is a delectable example of a fresh, vintage dated sparkling wine to impress and please. "
2393,Argyle Brut 2009,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",Sparkling & Champagne,90,"This Oregon sparkling wine truly brings zest to life! The nose of lemon curd, raw honey, and almond biscotti harkens to the uplifting and refreshing palate to follow. With a fine mousse that buoys one up and flavors of Comice pear, custard, and marzipan that dance across your tongue, one cannot resist a grin as the effervescence slowly fades to a clean, minerally, citrus-toned finish. With the second sip, you're guaranteed to be in an elevated state. Brut makes you better!  "
2394,Argyle Brut 2010,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",Sparkling & Champagne,90,"The balance and integrity of the 2010 growing season is striking, especially when viewed through the prism of our 2010 Vintage Brut. Lemon peel, strawberry pith, fresh ciabatta dough. The center is downreaching and creamy. In the background, a faint, brine accent persists, remnant of freshly shucked Kumumoto oysters. Energetic acidity and length, there is a satisfying resolution about this cuvée, inspiring one to reach for another glass of the fizz!"

The very first aromas are of raspberry, juicy anjou pear and hints of Tillamook strawberries. The tongue-tickling fizz introduces a clean, satisfying minerality with excellent balance and mild tannin. Essence of sun-warmed rose petals and pomegranate linger on the palate and evolve into sublime hints of cherry-currant and strawberry creme. Delicious on its own or paired with vegetarian fare, seafood, poultry, pizzas and any patisserie. "

From its pale salmon-pink depths, rise aromas of rose petals, spring's first strawberries, cherry blossoms, and just a hint of hay in a sun-drenched summer field. This Rosé shows a complex and elegant palate of red berries with underpinnings of licorice, guava, and filo pastry, all supported by a wonderfully slaty acidity and a delicate, yet persistent mousse. This is truly one of those ""Ah-ha"" moment wines that show why great Rosé never goes out of style."

They take advantage of the late-ripening spot to retain bright, fresh acidity and a mineral edge. The balance of the wine is equally blended between the aforementioned Knudsen Vineyards and their younger, but equally high elevation, Spirit Hill Vineyard in the Eola-Amity Hills.

2414,Argyle Dry Reserve Riesling 1997,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",White Wine,86,"The color of our 1997 Dry Riesling is light yellow with a green highlight. The nose is pure and the powerful ripe Riesling fruit is accentuated by strong mineral aromas and floral-citrus notes. Young Argyle rieslings have a common thread of ripe citrus flavors (more lime and lemon as opposed to orange) mingling with tree fruits (peach and apricot) and honey flavors. The 1997 vintage is no exception. As with past vintages, time in the bottle will enhance it's tree fruit flavors and temper the citrus ones. Our signature fruit sweetness exposes itself in mid-palate only to be followed and punctuated by a crisp, fresh, palate-cleansing acidity.

2420,Argyle Extended Tirage Brut 1995,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",Sparkling & Champagne,90,"What were you doing twelve years ago? We were picking the grapes that have become this sparkling wine. Since then it has been aging slowly on yeast in the bottle in our cool temperature warehouse. The color is a rich, youthful yellow. After ten years of waiting, the aromas are ready to punch out of the glass with a rich potpourri of wild ginger root, Gala apple, and a splash of nectarine, tangerine and mandarin! The flavor is extra creamy in texture. The bubbles are tiny and foamy. The fruit flavors of the aroma complex with pink pepper spice and baked filo dough yeastiness. Mouth-filling richness is translated into a very long and fresh finish. This wine will also age for quite some time on cork if cellared properly. "

2423,Argyle Extended Tirage Brut 2000,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",Sparkling & Champagne,93,"What were you up to in the year 2000? It proved to be one of the most fascinating vintages in Oregon. If you've ""socked"" my Nuthouse chardonnay and Prestige level Pinot Noirs away in the cellar, you are one of the very lucky ones. I love how complex 10 years on yeast sparkling can get. The aromas include a revolving sense of red plum- apple pie, ripe pear fruit, blossom honey, graham cracker yeastiness, and dare I say exotic mango-like creaminess. We could go on and on about how many wine descriptors there are for this great wine. I'll donate a few words here and look forward to hearing about yours. I got beautiful ripe pear and mango-smoothie fruit and creaminess that wrapped itself around an amazing mineral acidity. The beginning, middle, and finish are a cornucopia of fruit, richness of mouth-feel that we've come to expect out of this great wine offering. If prodded, one can find mango-apricot-pear (Nashi and Anjou), apple (red and yellow ones, not green ones)-crabapple fruit hints. The yeast age is just right, like flakey brioche aromas spritzing through the rich fruit flavor of this fine fizz. "
2424,Argyle Extended Tirage Brut 2001,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",Sparkling & Champagne,93,"Honeysuckle, brioche, and honey drizzled chevre on warm toasted artisan bread are the first things to hit you on the nose of this ten year old bubbly. The next thing that grabs you about this straw colored beauty is how amazingly fine the mousse is. I have never seen an Argyle sparkling wine, with such delicate, tiny bubbles. That delicacy dances across the palate just like the old monk said, ""I am drinking the stars!""  Age has brought this wine amazingly rich flavors of vanilla bean, crème brûlée, persimmon, and baked pear with delicate hints of licorice, peach, and spun sugar. It's astounding that a flavor profile can be so creamy yet have such a defined thread of acidity woven through it, but this wine does, finishing with the clean acidity of a perfect sparkler. "
2426,Argyle Extended Tirage Brut 2005,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",Sparkling & Champagne,93,"After a two year absence, Argyle Extended Tirage Brut returns! Being Pinot Noir-dominant and full malolactic-fermented in neutral barrels, the 2005 ET is driven more by structure and texture, while still retaining outstanding energy and endurance. Fruit mince spice, orange rind, and grilled peach are layered with almond, brioche, and soft supple creaminess. The energy continues through the long, driving finish, embraced by gentle minerality and tension. Made with 65% Pinot Noir, 35% Chardonnay."
2427,Argyle Knudsen Blanc de Blanc 1996,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",Sparkling & Champagne,90,"Aromas of fresh ripe apples and Asian pears, limes and melons, with overtones of vanilla bean and toasted hazelnuts.

2428,Argyle Knudsen Brut 1996,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",Sparkling & Champagne,87,"Powerful nose of roasted apple, pear tart with a butter crust, a hint of freshly cooked cranberries, and a toasted baguette.

2434,Argyle Nuthouse Chardonnay 2006,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",White Wine,90,The aromas are very complex yet fruit forward. Look for fruit aromas of limetta and white peach with spices of cinnamon and high-elevation grown Sikotak clove. All this excitement is wrapped up with a hint of fresh baked pecan pie.  
2435,Argyle Nuthouse Chardonnay 2007,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",White Wine,92,"This is our first Nuthouse Chardonnay to be dominantly from Lone Star Vineyard. Unlike Pinot Noir, we have found that Chardonnay vines require more age before ""making the grade"". In this case, the vines were 8 years old. "
2436,Argyle Nuthouse Chardonnay 2008,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",White Wine,92,"Our good friends in Burgundy are always excited when they can get the elusive aroma and flavor of toasted hazelnuts in their Chardonnays. In this example of the Nuthouse Chardonnay we have captured just that. Those hazelnuts are complimented by a toasted marshmallow, ripe cantaloupe, and Bosc pear on the nose. Look for the ripe white peach, melon and a generous splash of fresh nutmeg and clove oak spice. The wine finishes with a long cut pear and mineral thread that is so indicative of the cool climate in which it was grown. "
2437,Argyle Nuthouse Chardonnay 2009,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",White Wine,91,"Mouthwatering is the first descriptor that comes to mind. A nose of sweet white peach, orange blossom and cool nectarine with an overlay of toasted hazelnuts, clove and allspice that is so fresh, pure and clean that it just fires up those salivary glands. It opens with a full mouth feel with notes of baked peach and toasted hazelnuts and delicious notes of honey and hints of graham cracker. The palate finishes with clean oak spice notes and a stony minerality that quenches and excites. Pour me another glass of that Nuthouse! "
2438,Argyle Nuthouse Chardonnay 2011,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",White Wine,91,"A slightly lower percentage of new oak this vintage, the fresh, bright aromatics really shine. White peach, Comice pear, and Castelvetrano olives are emphasized around an incredibly unctuous, creamy frame, all focused by the underlying, razor's edge acidity. Subtle, spicy accents of nutmeg and ginger dance around the long, mouthwatering finish. It'll live for many years. I'm thinking smoked rabbit, gigandes beans, romesco, saffron broth."
2439,Argyle Nuthouse Chardonnay 2012,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",White Wine,90,"Nuthouse Chardonnay is all about the interplay of savory texture and mineral edge. There is a satisfying and long lasting richness that is hard to define in words. A chord which travels from the back of the palate, through the spine and into the crust of the volcanic soil of the Willamette Valley. Fresh cut wheat, lemon sabayon, crêpes suzette, and delicate flake pastry. There is a degree of convection, the concerted, collective movement of groups or aggregates of molecules within this chardonnay, one may say the third dimension. It brings dreams of char-grilled crustaceans and blackened squid. "
2440,Argyle Nuthouse Chardonnay 2013,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",White Wine,90,"Grilled peach, wild honey, suggestions of nougat and roast almonds are framed around dense, yet crystalline delicacy. Warmer than the previous vintage, and without the distraction of late September rains, the 2014 vintage has brought beautifully ripe flavors. Entirely barrel-fermented, the wine was allowed to age elegantly on full lees for 16 months in French oak, of which 40% was new. The middle palate fills the mouth with strength and texture, while finishing with long, caressing, silky vibration."
2441,Argyle Nuthouse Pinot Noir 2000,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",Red Wine,92,"The color is a very deep ruby red color. Look for sun thickened black cherry and cassis stock reduction type aromas, accompanied by licorice and toasted fresh sawn oak and cedar. All these aromas are packed into a box of sweet, floral scents reminiscent of garden Violets at evening time. The flavor is very thick of sweet ripe red fruits, silky smooth on the tongue. The freshness of the fruit flavors carry all the way through to the end without a dip in the middle palate. This wine is Tannin rich, but tastes like the rough corners of the tannin molecules have been sanded smooth. The finish is long, long of sweet fresh red fruit, with just a hint of fresh spaded earth."

2445,Argyle Nuthouse Pinot Noir 2005,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",Red Wine,93,"The aroma is tumescent with blueberry fruit. Blended with this wonderful robust blue fruit one can find Moroccan spices, a hint of butterscotch, and a sense of gravelly earthiness.  "
2446,Argyle Nuthouse Pinot Noir 2006,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",Red Wine,92,"This is our Classic ""big furniture"" Pinot Noir style derived from Lone Star Vineyard. Its melanite color is the first indicator of its boldness. The aroma is black cherry reduction fruit, black licorice, Earl Grey spices, and that luscious, fresh earth quality that says ""Nuthouse"". The flavors are big, juicy black cherry and black plum pudding spices. The texture forms a rich, creamy center to this richly ripe Pinot Noir. The ripe plum and cherry fruit carry on and on. It is a wonderful thing to experience such powerful, exotic Pinot Noir yet wonder at its bright, balanced, mineral pinpoint touch twirling on the palate."
2447,Argyle Nuthouse Pinot Noir 2007,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",Red Wine,90,"Whoa, buddy! I tasted this wine immediately after our 2000 Extended Tirage and was expecting to be underwhelmed after enjoying such a noble wine as our ET. Result: this may be the most interesting, complex, and balanced Pinot Noir we've made here! The aromas jump out of the glass with bright vibrancy. Rich Bing cherry fruit, Santa Rosa plum, pie spices, cinnamon stick, with bouquet of forest loam and woods-edge Northwest bramble fruits make this a very seductive Pinot Noir. The mouth-feel is surprisingly silky and concentrated in texture. The middle palate has delightful juiciness of Bing cherry and red plum fruit. From middle to its long finish this wine is complexed by presence of spices reminiscent of bergamot and citrus oil, with a hint of the sort of herb component that evolves into floral aromas with age."
2448,Argyle Nuthouse Pinot Noir 2008,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",Red Wine,92,"Here's a wine that will require some time to sit back and ponder over. The obvious notes on the nose of big juicy sweet Oregon blackberries and Rainier cherries have layers of summer cedar forest, strawberry rhubarb cobbler, and roses so deeply red they hurt adding aromatic complexities. Richness is exuded by this wine that has a palate full of berries fresh off the vine and exotic Asian spices, but with a graceful elegance that is anything but cumbersome. It is a rare and beautiful thing to find a Pinot Noir with this much power that still maintains the balance and finesse that defines the best that the varietal can be."
2449,Argyle Nuthouse Pinot Noir 2009,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",Red Wine,91,"For those of you familiar with the Nuthouse style, you'll know that on release these wines don't always leap out of the glass, they need time in the bottle to open up aromatically. Not the case with the 2009 Nuthouse Pinot Noir! This wine is alive with aromas of darkest cherry, cloves and cinnamon. It is no different on the palate—almost explosive in its expression of sweet juicy marionberry, raspberry cordial, and black cherry cobbler framed in subtle oak tannins. Definitely a big wine, but a big wine with grace and elegance enough to lift you up and put a smile on your face. "
2450,Argyle Nuthouse Pinot Noir 2010,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",Red Wine,92,"A deep, almost maroon, magenta color on this 2010 Nuthouse Pinot Noir speaks to the richness in the glass. This wine has a strong affinity to the Pacific Northwest with notes of bilberry, red raspberry, black cherry cordial, Douglas fir bark, and a hint of forest floor. There is a cool, darkness in a palate leaning toward the black fruits – Damson plum, blackberry, black currant, and blackcap. Texturally, the 2010 Nuthouse Pinot Noir is soft, but with generous tannins and a round mouth-feel where deftly handled oak integrates with the fruit profile harmoniously. This wine is youthful and still has much to offer with aging that will bring out a host of tertiary characteristics over the next decade. "
2451,Argyle Nuthouse Pinot Noir 2012,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",Red Wine,90,"The 2012 Nuthouse Pinot Noir displays brilliant garnet color with aromas that are initially delicate and ethereal, hinting at fresh rose petal and red earth. As it opens up, more complex aromas emerge of dark chocolate, anise and wild cherries. The mid palate is deep and creamy, posed against firm tanning and long savory acid. "
2452,Argyle Nuthouse Pinot Noir 2013,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",Red Wine,90,"Showing bright raspberry, spicy floral and black tea flavors, all woven into a rich, yet energetic frame. A mild grip of tannins is carried through a long, savory finish."
2453,Argyle Nuthouse Pinot Noir 2015,,"Eola-Amity Hills, Willamette Valley, Oregon",Red Wine,90,"Entirely from Lone Star Vineyard, 2015 Nuthouse Pinot Noir exhibits the opulence and power of the Eola-Amity Hills while still retaining fresh fruit and vibrant acidity. Wild cherry, marionberry, roast fennel, and black tea frame its dense core, while the firm tannins persist through its long, creamy finish. "
2454,Argyle Nuthouse Pinot Noir 2016,,"Eola-Amity Hills, Willamette Valley, Oregon",Red Wine,91,"Entirely from their Lone Star Vineyard, the 2016 Nuthouse Pinot Noir exhibits the richness and power of the Eola-Amity Hills while still retaining fresh fruit and vibrant acidity. Black raspberry, rose petal, blood orange, and allspice are framed its dense core, while the finely woven tannins persist through its long, creamy finish. "
2455,Argyle Nuthouse Riesling 2013,,"Eola-Amity Hills, Willamette Valley, Oregon",White Wine,90,"Lone Star Vineyard has three separate blocks of Riesling totaling just under 7 acres of fruit, which amounts to less than 2% of our overall farming. Winemaking and blending is all about creating options and tools, so we have taken these three tiny blocks and cut them up into both stainless steel and neutral oak fermentations to give us more tools to play with. The stainless versions are left with a hint of residual sugar, which emphasize fresh, pure, round fruit while the neutral oak barrels are taken bone dry to bring the dichotomic elements of both mineral edge and subtle, creamy texture. The blending between these two styles across the three blocks of Riesling create an excitement and energy in the salvaries. Heavenly white nectarine, lime blossom, and silvery minerality. Break out the Costillas de Puerco!"
2456,Argyle Nuthouse Riesling 2018,,"Eola-Amity Hills, Willamette Valley, Oregon",White Wine,91,"At the top of Lone Star Vineyard, planted to high density on devigorated rootstock, Nuthouse Riesling soaks up the generous morning Eola-Amity Hills sunshine. Upon harvesting, the grapes were chilled overnight, de-stemmed, and then put back into the cold room to soak on their skins for 48 hours before pressing. Cool, slow neutral barrel fermentation and aging on the lees for 11 months has enhanced texture while buoying vibrant freshness. Ginger, lemon peel, and apricot glide into the long, silky textured finish. "
2457,Argyle Pinot Noir 1999,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",Red Wine,91,"This Pinot Noir is a deep red violet color. Super ripe, deep, blueberry- blackberry jam, tar, earthy, thick, viscous, seasoned cedar, violets, etc. are the terms resonating in both aroma and flavor of this year s offering.  Imagine a blackberry vine visited in early Fall loaded with over-ripe neglected berries. All these flavors and more are framed by firm tannins and linger on the palate long, long after the glass is finished. Worth cellaring for 3-4 years, or decanting before serving if you cant wait that long."
2458,Argyle Pinot Noir 2000,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",Red Wine,88,"This Pinot Noir is a bright, deep ruby red. The aromas are of a complex combination of spices (cardamom, cinnamon, vanilla), black fruits, and earth. Flavors lean toward black fruits; black cherries and blackberries with a small earthy and seasoned cedar component.. Medium-bodied, this wine is unctuous with big fruit and a firm tannin finish sanded by sweetness from the fruit flavors.. The finish is long with a nice balance between sweet, ripe fruit and soft, chewy tannins. Drink now or cellar three to four years."

2461,Argyle Pinot Noir 2003,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",Red Wine,89,"This Willamette Valley Pinot Noir is one of the biggest and richest in some time. Much of our prized 'Prestige' vineyard blocks went into the blend for this wine. Black Cherry, Marion berry, and spice aromas are concentrated around a tight mineral/earth/tar center. The flavors are sweet, big fruited, and built up with ripe, gripping tannin structure. The finish is what we all look for in Pinot Noir, long sweet with fruit and floral hints. This wine despite its value-price category will age well in to the first decade of the 2000's. "
2462,Argyle Pinot Noir 2007,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",Red Wine,90,"The color is bright garnet! The aroma is a wonderful red cherry and cranberry fruit, chocolate spice, and a neat earth ""Jory soil after a fall rainstorm""-like hint. The flavor is bright, complex, and fun. Look for red fruit of cherry and cranberry, cobbled mineral, Siskiyou forest floor, and black pepper spice. The red fruit fills and carries throughout the palate in a mouthwatering sweet centered finish!"
2463,Argyle Pinot Noir 2009,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",Red Wine,89,"2009 was all about farming to balance Mother Nature's surprises. Argyle's farming culture got the crop level right on. We stripped leaves after the burning sun of August and in time for the Labor Day rains. We also believed September's drying, east wind forecast and put a security of water onto the vines to help them ride out the drying, late season heat with a maximum of ripening—which is the name of the game here in the Willamette Valley. Picking was unusually ""segmented"" this year. Usually we can say that every 200' rise in elevation can mean 10 days difference in ripening and thus picking. But in 2009 Argyle picked high and low elevation fruit at the same time! We picked all the sparkling fruit, then rested for a couple of days, then all the Chardonnay for still wine, rested another few days then all the red came in. The resulting wines are gorgeous, perky and sexy. I don't know that I have seen a more sensuous expression of flavor and aromas in my 23 years of Willamette Valley winemaking. "
2464,Argyle Pinot Noir 2008,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",Red Wine,90,"You are all going to like this Pinot Noir. Besides the raspberry and cherry fruit aromas, this is the first Willamette Pinot I've ever gotten bright boysenberry fruit aromas from! Deep underlying scents of fresh tilled earth and Eastern spice rack further add to the complexity and wonderful smell of this classic Willamette Valley Pinot Noir. The mouth-feel and flavor exceed what one expects from the already enticing smell. This wine has lovely balance for those red fruits wrapped up into a velvet-textured tannin shell. The center of the palate is cherry creme with bright minerality. Enjoy a long lasting finish accented by red cherry and a hint of dark chocolate. "
2465,Argyle Pinot Noir 2010,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",Red Wine,90,"Imagine a walk down a Pacific Northwest forest trail in September, the warm, dry smell of firs and sunshine with ripe blackberries hanging off the vines and the cool trickle of a babbling brook over wet stones. That sums up the 2010 Argyle Willamette Valley Pinot Noir. This Pinot Noir has a surprising amount going on in the glass - from up front fruit to earthy complexity and spice nuances. Enjoy this taste of the Willamette Valley on the patio or on the forest trail. "
2466,Argyle Pinot Noir 2012,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",Red Wine,90,"Argyle Pinot Noir is honest and unmingled. The 2012 vintage for Pinot Noir made itself. Fermented in small lots, and blended for purity, this year's blend croons of ripe, red raspberry, morello cherry and a hint of backwoods spice. No other word can describe the palate but lush. Gentle, slightly firm tannin beneath, the acid sings true and long. Enjoy early, or sit on it a few years for enhanced nuance."
2467,Argyle Pinot Noir 2015,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",Red Wine,90,"Argyle Pinot Noir is 100% Argyle-grown. Willamette Valley Pinot Noir is a stunning showcase of classic, cool-climate varietal character. Blackberry, black cherry, spicy complexity folds nicely into the fresh earth on the middle palate."
2468,Argyle Pinot Noir 2017,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",Red Wine,90,"Argyle Pinot Noir is a veritable representation of the Willamette Valley. Fermented entirely in small, 1.5 ton lots and plunged by hand, Argyle Pinot Noir is blended for purity and focus. The 2017 vintage toes the line between red and dark fruit with savory spice and delicate floral notes. Late season ripening in 2017 lends itself to a lively, fresh middle palate along with classic Argyle silky texture and persistent length."
2469,Argyle Reserve Chardonnay 1994,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",White Wine,90,"The concentrated aromas are packed with ripe fruits: melon, fig, pear and apple. The ripe fruit aromas are framed by aromatic spices reminiscent of vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg. The flavors carry ripe melon wrapped in toasted hazelnut and sweet oak. The mouth feel is quite rich and viscous, yet retains a structured mineral backbone. Fruit and toasted hazelnut linger on the finish."
2470,Argyle Reserve Chardonnay 1996,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",White Wine,90,"The nose is aromatic with the perfume of fresh tropical fruit; pineapple, melon and mango along with passion fruit, pears and apricot. Honey, hints of allspice originating from the toasted oak, ripe melon, and fresh, ripe anjou pear and nutmeg."

2472,Argyle Reserve Chardonnay 1998,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",White Wine,89,"Made entirely from small cluster clones, Dijon clones, grafted onto devigorating rootstocks, gives this wine ripe fruit aromas of melon, fig, and pear. Spice scents of vanilla and clove further complex the fruit aromas. The flavors are a rich, viscous vehicle carrying ripe melon, toasted hazelnut, and sweet oak. Expect a very long fresh fruit finish from this predictably age-worthy wine."
2473,Argyle Reserve Pinot Noir 1999,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",Red Wine,91,"How can this wine be so Big yet exhibit so much complexity and generosity? Aromas of wild black fruits like our dried Himilayan blackberries predominate but are also complex by ample portions chocolate covered cherries and rare spices, forest soil, toasted grain, and sweet floral essences. The flavor is ripe, silky black raspberry and earthy. Trademark silky and sweet impressions help mask the firm, ample tannins.

Look for rose petal powered red fruit like cherry and raspberry fruit aromas. This is the ""feminine"" power that only Pinot Noir can capture in a wine glass.

2477,Argyle Reserve Pinot Noir 2005,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",Red Wine,91,"This Pinot Noir has a seductively rich, super dark ruby-violet color. Aromas leap out of the glass with black cherry, black cherry leather and cedar, along with a ripping portion of cinnamon spice. The wine finishes with a hint of violet flower patch. Use of new oak was delicate, so the aromas are authentic Pinot Noir.  "
2478,Argyle Reserve Pinot Noir 2007,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",Red Wine,90,"The aroma of this beautiful bright Pinot Noir offering has cherry blossom floral with ripe red cherry, raspberry jam, and spice laden vanilla bean complexities. The color is a cheerful ruby red and is extremely inviting. The flavors are red fruited, red cherry folded into Vosges forest oak spice of nutmeg and earth. The facula for this refreshing Pinot Noir is red currant, a first for my 23 years of Oregon winemaking! The cellar was chock full of wonderful, red raspberry aromas during fermentation in 2007. This wine is one to enjoy but seriously cellar, as it is red fruit freshness that lends age-ability. "
2479,Argyle Reserve Pinot Noir 2008,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",Red Wine,91,"This wine just sings classic Oregon Pinot Noir with delicate floral notes melding with ripe cherry and raspberry wrapped in a light robe of baking spices. The wine has a rich hued Burgundy color with a sparkling brilliance and great clarity. The wine opens with bright, clean flavors of black cherry and forest berries. The palate adds complexities of clove and nutmeg oak spice and hints of earthy tertiary flavors coming through. The long, elegant finish is complimented by Argyle's signature silky tannins. This is a wine that begs to be drunk now, but with self-control will pay the dividends of complexity and greater depth with aging."
2480,Argyle Reserve Pinot Noir 2009,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",Red Wine,90,"To coin a popular phrase, this is not your Mother's Reserve Pinot Noir! The wine has quiet power, yet voluptuous, sensuous fruit. The aromas offer spice of sandalwood, cedar box, and incense imbricated with lovely red and Bing cherry fruit, with a hint of moss on rock earthiness. The flavors bring out more red than black fruits which is characteristic of our Reserve vine blocks that make this wine label. The texture is super rich with surprising amounts of red cherry and cherry wood spice. This wine and the 2009 vintage are opulent enough to please the most discerning Sybarite!"
2481,Argyle Reserve Pinot Noir 2011,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",Red Wine,88,"Aromas in these cool growing seasons are always ""leap out of the glass"" intense! Look for violets, spiced black cherry, and a hint of blueberry blossom. The black cherry component evolves into red cherry/currant aromas with time in the glass. (That's like discovering the Fountain of Youth for Pinot Noir!). The texture is immediately a surprisingly dense mouthfeel, yet light on it's feet. Pinot noir red fruits abound throughout the palate. There's an amazing balance, where each segment of flavor from beginning, to middle, to the long finish is of equal intensity. This wine tap danced it's way straight into my own personal cellar, indeed!"
2482,Argyle Reserve Pinot Noir 2012,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",Red Wine,92,"A fantastic cross section of the Willamette Valley's finest offerings, our Reserve Pinot Noir is truly a celebration of balance. The fruit profile rides the line of red and dark fruit, and can lean in either direction depending on the day. Black cherry and Howes cranberry embraced by subtle, toasted hazelnuts, and vanillin. While the tannins are firm, but rounded, there is an underlying earthy minerality which drives the mid-palate through the long finish. While delving for pure fruit flavors and juicy acidity, we hang our phenolic hat on our trademark silky texture which has been enhanced through cold soaking in small lot fermenters, along with aging 16 months in French oak barriques.

This wine is tannin rich, but tastes like the rough corners of the tannin molecules have been sanded smooth.

This wine speaks volumes for elegance right of the bat. The flavor is full ripe red cherry fruit with surprising juicy centerdness. The bright fruit carries on long into the finish leaving a fresh red fruited impression. Seldom do we get a vintage that displays the ""nervosity"" one can enjoy from cool climate grown wines. It is this nervosity that lends one toward that ""Pavlov's Dog""salivating effect that rare wines can obtain."
2506,Argyle Spirithouse Pinot Noir 2008,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",Red Wine,93,"There was a lot of buzz about the greatness of the Oregon 2008 vintage, and this wine is the proverbial proof in the pudding. This youthful wine slowly opens in the glass, first showing off rich spice, delicate oak, and cigar box, then unwinding to let lush dark Bing cherry come to the forefront. On the palate, this wine is like drinking velvet—soft, rich, and luxurious. Flavors reminiscent of red current jam, fresh picked Damson plum, warm forest berry cobbler with a dollop of vanilla bean, and light brushed-leather notes. With so many nuances combined with a clean streak of acidity, this is a wine that will reward for years and years to come. "
2507,Argyle Spirithouse Pinot Noir 2009,,"Willamette Valley, Oregon",Red Wine,91,"The first clue to the depth of this wine is the striking garnet hue. This is a very seductive Pinot Noir wrapped in an aromatic robe of clove and allspice notes draped with juicy red raspberry and kirsch with nuances of incense cedar and roasted wild game. On the palate, the 2009 Spirithouse Pinot exudes class with an inviting structure of satiny tannins and a delicate balance of morello cherry driven fruit lifted by clean acidity and supported by just enough oak structure. This is a wine that will draw you in with its grace, elegance, and power."

2510,Argyros Assyrtiko 2016,,"Santorini, Greece",White Wine,90,"This wine represents that greatest expression of the estate terroir. Subtle oak influence highlights earthy flavor of Assyrtiko. This wine has a steely acidity, and shows fine tension on the finish."
2511,Argyros Assyrtiko 2018,,"Santorini, Greece",White Wine,90,"Assyrtiko is the iconic grape of Santorini, known for it's relatively high natural acidity. This wine is true to character, with flavors of citrus, lemongrass and stone. It is medium-bodied and elegant with great finesse. "

2513,Argyros Vinsanto 12 Year 2001,,"Santorini, Greece",,96,"The grapes used for Estate Argyros Assyrtiko are harvested from the oldest parcels of theestate. Located in Episkopi, the average age of the vines is 150  years old, with some vinesover 500 years old. Yields are extremely low. The ungrafted vines are basket pruned, and dryfarmed.

2516,Arianna Occhipinti SP68 Rosso 2015,,"Sicily, Italy",Red Wine,91,"Named for the road going past the winery, SP68 is a blend of Nero d'Avola and Frappato. This is a perfect balance of power and finesse; the Nero imparts rich dark fruits and the Frappato adds a high-toned raspberry note."
2517,Arietta Cabernet Sauvignon 2007,,"Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,90,"The core of the Arietta Cabernet Sauvignon 2007 is Cabernet Sauvignon from the sensational Arietta Block in Coombsville. This small cool-climate viticultural area (about four square miles) just east of the town of Napa is the source of spectacularly good Bordeaux varietals, particularly Cabernet Sauvignon, which flourishes in the volcanic ash at the foot of Mount Saint George. Arietta winemaker Andy Erickson caps the Arietta block's production at two and a half tons per acre in order to assure uniform ripeness and concentrated flavors at harvest. The beautiful harmonics of the Arietta Cabernet 2007 gain additional complexity and overtones through the addition of Cabernet Franc (17%) and Petit Verdot (3%). "
2518,Arietta Cabernet Sauvignon 2015,,"Coombsville, Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,94,"The wines are a reflection of the stalwart nature of the Arietta vineyard blocks: overtly aromatic, richly textured, and packed with generous black fruit flavors. The dry conditions of the 2015 growing season only helped to concentrate and accentuate the expressive nature of the wine.  "
2519,Arietta H Block Hudson Vineyard Red 2001,,"Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,87,"Combines restrained flavors of smoke, herb, berry and dusty cherry. Lean and trim. Perhaps time in the bottle will work in its favor. Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Drink now through 2008. 800 cases made. (JL) "
2520,Arietta H Block Hudson Vineyard Red 2002,,"Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,96,"""A prodigious effort, possibly the finest Arietta made to date, is the 2002 Arietta (equal parts Merlot and Cabernet Franc). Huge tannin is present along with monstrous extract and richness. Nevertheless, it is an elegant, pure offering displaying the same stunning character as its siblings. Notions of menthol, scorched rocks, mocha, black cherries, cassis, chocolate, and espresso are found in this terrific offering. It will be developed and forward upon release, but will last for 12-15 years.    Winemaker and part owner, John Kongsgaard, produces these wines in partnership with auctioneer, Fritz Hatton. They are all fashioned from fruit grown in the ""H Block"" of the Hudson Vineyard, the highest point on that large ranch. The vineyard is planted in white volcanic ash-dominated soils. The Cabernet Franc/Merlot blend is the Arietta and the Syrah/Merlot blend is named Variation One. These striking offerings have a European sensitivity for elegance, structure, and delineation, but are clearly products of California, as evidenced by their prodigious ripeness as well as intensity. They are expensive, but impressive efforts that should be long-lived."" - Wine Advocate"
2521,Arietta H Block Hudson Vineyard Red 2003,,"Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,93,"Arietta H Block has a plush character. The breadth and ripe fruit of the wine will make it relatively flattering to drink while young, but tremendous stuffing and depth will promote development in the bottle."
2522,Arietta H Block Hudson Vineyard Red 2005,,"Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,94,"Arietta H Block has a plush character. The breadth and ripe fruit of the wine will make it relatively flattering to drink while young, but tremendous stuffing and depth will promote development in the bottle."
2523,Arietta H Block Hudson Vineyard Red 2007,,"Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,95,"Arietta H Block 2007 has a plush character. The breadth and ripe fruit of the wine will make it relatively flattering to drink while young, but tremendous stuffing and depth will promote development in the bottle for fifteen years, at least."
2524,Arietta H Block Hudson Vineyard Red 2012,,"Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,94,"Arietta Red Wine H Block Hudson Vineyards is a blend of Cabernet Franc and Merlot. The Cabernet Franc provides the cassis, blueberry, brown sugar character, while the Merlot brings dark chocolate to the aroma and a chewy richness to the finish. The intense concentration masks the substantial tannin, which assures an evolution in bottle of at least ten years."
2525,Arietta H Block Hudson Vineyards Red Blend 2000,,"Carneros, California",Red Wine,96,"The ""H Block"" designation was first added to the Arietta Red Wine label in this vintage, and honors the extraordinary, 2.3 acre Cabernet Franc block at the top of the Hudson Ranch in Napa/Carneros which forms the core of the wine. This is another miraculously rich and dramatically aromatic Arietta, and once again is a product of a relatively cool and late vintage. Critic Robert Parker gave the 2000 Arietta H Block the highest score of any Napa Red Wine in the 2000 vintage. The blend is 50% Cabernet Franc and 50% Merlot. This wine has harmonized beautifully in the bottle and is hard to resist, though should evolve for another five or ten years. "
2526,Arietta H Block Hudson Vineyards Red Blend 2014,,"Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,94,"The H Block Cabernet Franc, co-fermented with Merlot, is particularly vibrant and multi-faceted in the 2014 vintage. The final blend shows notes of gravel, smoke, and dried sage, over a core of blackcurrant, blueberry, and cassis. In the glass, it is harmonious and vibrant, supple, generous and alive. Already remarkable for its interwoven textures, flavors and aromas, this vintage of H Block will continue to evolve for the next two decades, or longer."
2527,Arietta H Block Hudson Vineyards Red Blend 2016,,"Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,92,"This blend of 70% Cabernet Franc and 30% Merlot takes the expression of the Hudson Vineyard terroir to a new level of complexity. The core of the “H Block” cuvée comes from thirty-year-old Cabernet Franc vines planted on a rare volcanic outcropping just above the Hudson “Merlot Cathedral.” The 2016 vintage was co-fermented, taking just the heart of the Merlot block and harvesting it on the same day as the Cabernet Franc. As usual, native yeast fermentation, and a long, carefully controlled maceration helped to meld together the two varieties, bringing forward the best of what they have to offer. After aging for twenty months in two-thirds new French oak, the wine was bottled without fining or filtration to preserve the power and subtlety of the vintage. Aromas of lavender, orange blossom, and anise are in harmony with the ripe Napa Valley fruit profile. Solid and well textured, the wine flows across the palate, blackberry, currant, and black cherry flavors mixed with hints of dried flowers, flint, and black licorice. This vintage of “H Block” will certainly age for decades to come. "
2528,Arietta Merlot 1999,,"Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,92,"A dense, rich wine of great power, with firm tannic support, still on the young side. The size of the Arietta Merlot crop in 1999 (1000 cases of this wine were produced) allowed them to broaden distribution to top restaurants in the U.S. As a result the experience of drinking Arietta Merlot 1999 has generated more calls from enthusiasts wishing to become Arietta subscribers than any other wine. Drink with prior aeration or decantation, but you can anticipate a long life ahead."
2529,Arietta On The White Keys White Blend 2016,,"Carneros, California",White Wine,93,"The blend of 84% Sauvignon Blanc and 16% Semillon is woven together like fine fabric, the high, floral and tropical tones of the Sauvignon Blanc being held up by the deep, viscous, honeyed character of the Semillon. Whole cluster pressed, the juice was fermented in a combination of Stainless Steel barrels, neutral oak, and new French Oak. Only a small number of barrels were allowed to complete malolactic fermentation, which allows the natural acidity and freshness of the wine to stay in the foreground. "
2530,Arietta Quartet 2012,,"North Coast, California",Red Wine,93,"After several challenging, yet rewarding vintages, 2012 arrived as a gift from heaven. All four red varieties, in each of the Arietta vineyards, produced rich, aromatic fruit in abundance. It would be hard to exaggerate just how pleasing the wines from this vintage will be. The 2012 Quartet is a great example. The wine has a remarkable purity of fruit, with notes of fresh blueberries, blackberry pie, and crème de cassis, but with all the complexity we desire in Arietta. The many layers include notes of dried sage, licorice, gravel, smoke, and graphite. This wine is generous and hedonistic, yet should appeal to the Europhile as well. The nearly flawless fruit produced wines that required very little movement in the cellar, and, as always, was bottled without fining or filtration, so will pour out of the bottle with great structure and intensity. While Quartet is meant to be enjoyed immediately, this one will no doubt age for decades to come. The 2012 Quartet's composition is 57% Cabernet Sauvignon, 23% Cabernet Franc, 18% Merlot, 2% Petit Verdot"
2531,Arietta Quartet 2010,,"Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,93,"The 2010 Arietta Quartet is marked by substantial power and structure, which underpin the dark, concentrated, plush core of ripe fruits. The Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc seem to be driving the overall impression of the wine, with cassis, bramble and sage riding on a solid chassis of carefully extracted tannin and dense color. The framework is balanced and rounded by soft, supple flavors and textures brought by the addition of Merlot. "
2532,Arietta Red Blend 1998,,"Carneros, California",Red Wine,92,"A blend of 60% Cabernet Franc and 40% Merlot, with all grapes coming from the Hudson Ranch (as is the case for all Arietta wines produced between the 1997 and 2002 vintages.) Of all Ariettas this wine is the most approachable for present drinking, and a great crowd pleaser. It has plenty of power, with a rich, forward, and expansive character. How did they do it in the cool vintage of 1998? Continual thinning of crop until a very late pick (end of October) gave them uniform and very ripe fruit. A number of subscribers have called, asking for more of this wine. Their inability to honor these requests was due in part to their own enthusiastic consumption."
2533,Arietta Variation One 2001,,"Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,92,"A tremendous effort. Vivid, complex aromas, with dense, rich and well-defined fruit flavors. Excellent structure and acidity. Fine tannins and a beautiful core of currant, tar, raspberry, cherry and nutmeg scents. The finish sails on and on. Merlot and Syrah. Drink now through 2010. 600 cases made. (JL) "
2534,Arietta Variation One 2003,,"Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,92,"Arietta Red Wine Variation One is a blend of Merlot and Syrah, also from the Hudson Vineyards. The Syrah, from Hudson's Hermitage selection grown in gravel unusual in the Carneros, is co-fermented with the Merlot to give the blend a wild and penetrating quality. If the H Block wine is an homage to the Right Bank of Bordeaux, Variation One is a Napa Valley original. The plum and licorice aromas of Merlot blend imperceptibly with the forest floor, wild game qualities attributable to the Syrah in a wine without antecedent anywhere in the world. The vinification, barrel ageing, and bottling are similar to the Arietta H Block wine. Variation One may be served young, especially with wilder dishes, but the powerful, if supple, tannin will support its evolution in bottle for at least ten years."
2535,Arietta Variation One 2005,,"Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,92,"Arietta Variation One Napa Valley is a blend of Merlot and Syrah, also from the Hudson Vineyards. The N Block is the only vineyard in Kongsgaard's extensive experience with Merlot which naturally yields two and one half to three tons of fruit per acre without requiring thinning or hedging. This naturally balanced vineyard is a unique phenomenon; a gift from nature which is reflected in the harmonious quality of the wine. Syrah, from Hudson's Hermitage selection grown in gravel unusual in the Carneros, is co-fermented with the Merlot to give the blend a wild and penetrating quality. If the H Block wine is an homage to the Right Bank of Bordeaux, Variation I is a Napa Valley original. The plum and licorice aromas of Merlot blend imperceptibly with the forest floor, wild game qualities attributable to the Syrah in a wine without antecedent anywhere in the world. The vinification, barrel ageing, and bottling are similar to the Arietta H Block wine. Variation I may be served young, especially with wilder dishes, but the powerful, if supple, tannin will support its evolution in bottle for at least 10 years. "
2536,Arietta Variation One 2013,,"Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,90,"The 2013 Variation One is a powerhouse. But for all its dark, brooding character and solid build, this wine is surprisingly bright and fresh on the palate, with flavors of red cherries, roasted meat, and orange liqueur and chocolate. It continues to open and reveal notes of campfire, baked fruits, and wet gravel. Tannins are dry and firm, helping to bolster the broad, expansive impression."
2537,Arietta Variation One 2014,,"Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,94,"The caramel, smoked meat, and orange peel notes of the Syrah immediately float up as the wine is poured. The generous nature of the wine carries through to the palate, as flavors of blueberry and dark chocolate, surely coming from the Merlot, rush forward. The tannins are already round and polished in this wine, and the marriage of the dark, brooding nature of the Syrah, with the bright, electric blue Merlot fruit will only gain in excitement over the years. This will absolutely be a wine to follow as it continues to evolve in bottle over the next two decades or more.”"

Arínzano La Casona is a complex, expressive, elegant and harmonious wine, which embodies the expression of the soils, climate and surroundings that make up the spectacular landscape of Señorío de Arínzano."
2544,Arista Winery Russian River Valley Pinot Noir 2014,,"Russian River, Sonoma County, California",Red Wine,92,"The 2014 Russian River Valley Pinot Noir is a beautifully pure expression of the 2014 growing season in the heart of Sonoma County. This cuvée was made with a modest amount of new oak influence to allow the character of the vintage to take center stage. On the nose, copious amounts of juicy blue and red fruits testify to the warm, dry growing season. Notes of gingerbread, pain grille, raspberry reduction and wild strawberry follow suit. The palate boasts an exquisite purity of fruit centered on crushed cherries and fresh raspberries. Perfectly balanced on the palate, the wine is rich and long with just enough acid to pair with the soft, slightly chalky tannins for a pleasant, extended finish. Peak drinking window: 2016 through 2026."

2546,Arista Winery Russian River Valley Pinot Noir 2017,,"Russian River, Sonoma County, California",Red Wine,90,"The 2017 Russian River Valley Pinot Noir is a fresh, vibrant example of wines from the appellation in a great vintage. With a beautiful dark, translucent, garnet color, the wine invites the taster in. One is greeted by a nose of cool blue fruits, Herbes de Provence, black olive, spiced candy, and damp forest floor. A modest 20% new French oak frames a core of crunchy red fruit on the palate. The wine possesses great length with tangy acidity, and finishes with an herbal note and grippy tannins that marry pleasantly with the fruit and help carry the long finish. Peak drinking window: 2019 through 2026."
2547,Arkenstone Estate Red 2015,,"Howell Mountain, Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,97,"Ruby red with deep black undertones, this dense yet elegantly focused beauty is a very special expression of the Howell Mountain terroir, and the beautiful 2015 vintage. Cassis, violet, mocha, graphite, and dried tea leaves greet the nose, along with our signature earth, sweet tobacco, and leather. A clean minerality and bright acidity are complemented by dark black cherry, star anise and mocha on the front palate while deep espresso, blackberry cobbler, blueberries, lavender and baking spices roundly fill the mid-palate. Very fine, lush tannins hold the richly dark chocolate, cassis-laden, long velvety finish. This wine is drinking beautifully balanced and youthfully vibrant right now, but will easily lie down for 30+ years."
2548,Arkenstone Estate Red 2016,,"Howell Mountain, Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,95,The Arkenstone Estate Blend consists entirely of fruit from their Howell Mountain Estate ranging from 1400' to 1650' on the western shoulder of the mountain.

2549,Arkenstone Howell Mountain Sauvignon Blanc 2016,,"Howell Mountain, Napa Valley, California",White Wine,91,"The Arkenstone Estate Sauvignon Blanc originally planted in 1997 is grown in 6 different very steep, very rocky, vineyard blocks on their Howell Mountain Estate. Choosing to plant only in the perfect patches of nutrient lacking, well-drained, white volcanic soils they are able to grow very concentrated, rich, but balanced, beautiful Sauvignon Blanc. Along with the Sauvignon Blanc in the lower part of their vineyard, they also farm a small block of Semillon which is blended with their Sauvignon Blanc. The percentage of Semillon will change with each vintage, but the results are always consistent. The Semillon adds beautiful floral aromatics along with a bigger mid-palate that seamlessly complements and integrates with the Sauvignon Blanc's natural notes of melon, citrus, and minerality. From their rigorous farming practices to winemaking to their final blend, this wine is very much a tip of the cap to the classic white wines of Bordeaux. As with all 13 acres of the Arkenstone Estate , the Sauvignon Blanc and Semillon are both farmed exclusively in-house using only organic farming techniques overseen by Winemaker Sam Kaplan."
2550,Arkenstone NVD Cabernet Sauvignon 2015,,"Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,92,"This deep purple, violet-rimmed wine has an opulent nose of ripe Santa Rosa Plum, rose petal, chocolate covered cherry cordial and stewed rhubarb. Hints of candied orange rind and blueberries lead to soft, yet explosive mouth-filling blackberry, black cherry, molasses, and nutmeg. Clean acidity and focused tannins balance this full-bodied plushness. The long, silky finish leaves traces of violet, black cherry and just a bit of white pepper. Incredibly approachable now, it will also age well into the next 20 years."
2551,Arkenstone NVD Cabernet Sauvignon 2017,,"Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,92,"Crimson with a garnet core. This Cabernet greets you with violets, ripe red cherry, lilac and graphite on the nose. The complexity resulting from the blend of beautiful Eastern mountain vineyards translates into bright ripe red fruits, cassis and pomegranate on the front palate, seamlessly moving to black raspberry, blueberry, orange peel, dark chocolate and rosemary exploding mid-palate. Eucalyptus, fresh herbs, mocha and black cherry round out the long satisfying finish."

These old Zinfandel vines (85+ years) are dry farmed resulting in wines of great depth and concentration. The beautiful Zinfandel clusters are sorted a minimum of three times to ensure that only the highest quality fruit is being used for this unique single-vineyard wine. Half of the wine was fermented in an open-top tank to soften the tannin structure. Only free-run wine was gently transferred to French and American oak barrels to age for 16 months.

2570,Armida Poizin Zinfandel 2009,,"Dry Creek Valley, Sonoma County, California",Red Wine,90,"A lush, delicious and ""serious"" wine but in a fun package! The nose is fruit driven with fresh plum, bing cherry, spicy peppercorn and zinberry. The mouthfeel is soft with a hint of milk chocolate, sweet oak, and a long vanilla finish. The deep color and firm structure are enhanced by the addition of the Petite Sirah and the firm tannins softened by moderate oak. Enjoy this POIZIN with caution; it is The Wine to Die for!  "
2571,Armida Russian River Sauvignon Blanc 2013,,"Russian River, Sonoma County, California",White Wine,90,"The Estate Sauvignon Blanc is grown in the cool fog-influenced Russian River Valley. These cool nights and warm days give the wine rich tropical fruit flavors balanced by a minerality backbone of citrus fruits. The 2013 vintage was cold fermented completely dry in a stainless steel tank to secure all of the esters and aromas in the wine. One-third of the juice was soaked on the skins for 16 hours prior to pressing, to increase aromatics and mouthfeel. Aromas of feijoa, yuzu, and gooseberry precede the kiwi-fruit, apple and lemon sorbet flavors on the pallet. Enjoy this wine on the porch by itself, as an aperitif with cheese appetizers or paired with shellfish dishes.  "
2572,Armida Russian River Sauvignon Blanc 2016,,"Russian River, Sonoma County, California",White Wine,90,"Summertime in a glass. Peaches, pear, guava and jasmine aromas explode from the glass. Subtle hints of gooseberry and pine needles add to the complexity of enticing aromas. The wine begins on the palate like taking a fresh bite out of a crisp pear. Sweet apricot and green apples dance along the tongue. The limey, textured finish is refreshing with just a hint of toasted cashews from the very small percentage of the wine fermented in oak. "
2573,Arnaldo Caprai 25 Anni Montefalco Sagrantino 2008,,"Umbria, Italy",Red Wine,91,"This rich Sagrantino is a great wine to be paired with roasted or grilled lamb and other meats. Black truffles, game and aged cheeses are also lovely partners to match the tannins and body shown in the bottle."

2593,Arnaldo Rivera Barolo Ravera 2015,,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",Red Wine,90,"Arnaldo Rivera is the flagship range of wines from Terre del Barolo. This Barolo comes from the Ravera Cru, a top site in Novello, sourced from six parcels at a high elevation of around 1300 feet. The nose is intensely smoky, with raspberry and strawberry aromas. The calcareous white soils produce beautiful fruit aromatics, whilst the due-south sun-facing aspect add considerable depth to the fruit and ripeness to the firm tannins. Directness of fruit is also brought forward by a degree less oak than their other Cru wines, with some smaller format wood -- but none of it new. It's sleek and stylish, a lifted wine that's taut and spicy with fine-grained tannins. There's tension and persistence here, with a long and elegant finish. A long and profound Barolo to approach now or cellar a good while, the Ravera is a classic."
2594,Arnaldo Rivera Barolo Undicicomuni 2015,,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",Red Wine,92,"Barolo Undicicomuni is arguably Arnaldo Rivera’s most important wine. Spiced cedar, leather and scorched earth on the nose. The palate is wild and savory with notes of crushed raspberry, figs, cinnamon, star anise alongside velvety dusty tannins and fresh acidity. It’s stylish meaty and delicious and super uber Nebbiolo cool. Blending fruit from across the Langhe’s eleven Barolo villages, it epitomizes the quintessential values of traditional, historic Barolo. While the ArnaldoRivera single vineyard Barolos are stunning, it is the Barolo Undicicomuni that demands the winemaker’s greatest attention. He is required to blend different fruit and terroir expressions from diverse villages, just as an artist balances colors to complete his work of art. This means that the Barolo Undicicomuni is naturally Arnaldo Rivera’s most complex Barolo. A shorter ageing in wood, instead of the 32 months of each cru, allows the wine to be more accessible and suitable for early drinking. A consistently great example of Barolo."

The site was planted in 1980 to the old Wente clone of Chardonnay which is considered by many to be the heritage selection of Chardonnay in California.The soils in this cool climate site are sandy loam and the vines are carefully tended by Richard Alfaro. Harvest often stretches until mid October and the resulting wines are high in natural acidity with a notable salinity on the palate."

Exposed and austere, the Watson Ranch is a wind whipped site planted in 1993 on marine deposits over limestone. This soil type is extremely rare on the North Coast and is coupled with organic farming techniques, giving this parcel great potential to produce Chardonnay of singular character, structure and nuance."

From its first year, it will fill you with wonder at its delicate purple colour with hints of violet, and its aromas of red fruits. Depending on the year, one can savour hints of underwood and spices. After 2-3 years of laying down, it is finer and its taste more developed. Around 5 years of age it will have achieved a lovely maturity and will honour your red meats, white meats in sauce, cold meats and cheeses. "

2605,Arns Cabernet Sauvignon 1999,,"Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,89,"Low crop yields and a long growing season produced a dark, concentrated wine that is packed with flavor. The tannins are smoother and this wine is more like a california style cabernet than many of our other wines. It has a rich dark color and is bursting with black fruit, allspice, and cherry flavors. This wine will continue to develop for the next few years and will last for many more.   "
2606,Arrayan Seleccion 2007,,Spain,Red Wine,90,"Medium density ruby red color. Aromas of ripe fruit and spices. Hints of cigar box and leather in its elegant bouquet are attributable to the ageing process.  Fresh and straightforward in the mouth, with a long finish. "

Earthy and floral notes of peat and jasmine tea and mahogany wood make for a diverse aromatic profile. There is tons of energy on the entry making way for a vibrant and age-worthy wine. In the palate the fruit is prominent and unspoilt leaning toward both a rich blueberry pie and fresh cherry and red berries. It’s dark and spicey and warmly cocoa influenced- reminiscent of chocolate truffles. The structure reflects the unique heritage of this wine: the steep slopes of the Stagecoach Vineyard overlooking Oakville and the well-drained alluvial fan of St. Helena. Built for enjoyment, this wine is eager to please and will enjoy a long life ahead."
2608,Arrow & Branch Dr. Crane Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon 2013,,"Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,93,"This expression of pure Cabernet is youthful and sweet.

Boasting incredible color, the nose is harmoniously fruity and floral, reminiscent of rose hips and olallieberry jam. A compelling vein of rich, moist loam and dried porcini winds into the palate. Here earth gives way to fruit and we find ripe cherries and sweet, dark cassis. The wine is agile on the tongue; ample, fresh and lithe. The judicious use of oak ensures an attractive spice, toast, and vanillin that dance about the wine. Primarily Cabernet Franc, it is a classic, medium to full bodied beauty that can be enjoyed upon release and will improve over the next 8-10 years."
2610,Arrow & Branch Red 2013,,"Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,94,"With a warm dry spring, consistent summer temperatures and cool sunny weather through out October it was a near perfect growing season in 2013. The 2013 Red Wine is a true Cabernet Franc based blend. This perfumed wine invites with warm spices and lavender. It is fruit focused with ripe fleshy dark cherry, hints of liquor and blueberry.

2614,Arrowood Kuljian Dry Creek Syrah 2004,,"Dry Creek Valley, Sonoma County, California",Red Wine,91,"Kuljian produces a Syrah that is more opulent and hedonistic than Saralee's. This 2004 is deeply colored and packed with dark fruit, plums, earth, and Chinese camphor. As in past vintages, it has a character that can best be described as smoked butcher block. Big, ripe and dense, this is a brooding wine with rich ripe tannins and great aging potential.  "

The vineyard team worked hard through the season to ensure even ripeness among the berries.

The fruit is forward with layered spice characteristics. Rich raspberry and plum flavors are etched nicely with hints of nutmeg and clove spice. The wine is lightly oaked in a combination of new and older French oak. With the release of the 1997 Sangiovese, it is clear why Atlas Peak Vineyards has become Americas leading producer of this wonderful Tuscan grape variety. The 97 Sangiovese lends itself to a marinara-sauced pasta or a simple rustic pizza with sun-dried tomatoes and fresh mozzarella. Try marinating steak with pepper and garlic for another delicious pairing."

2867,Atlas Peak Spring Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon 2006,,"Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,93,"Due to its position in the valley, the overall growing season on Spring Mountain tends to be slightly warmer than other Napa mountain AVAs. These growing conditions provide Spring Mountain with considerable versatility; creating the perfect blend of climate, soils and exposure for growing Cabernet Sauvignon. The wines from Spring Mountain often display more moderate, but substantial, fruit definition, and a suppler mouthfeel than the same grapes from other Napa Valley mountain appellations. This 2006 Spring Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon shows deep red purple color and lots of soft tannins, wrapped in intensely rich red stone fruit. "

A special vinification practice led to the use of this term: the must remains in contact with the skins for 24 hours and this practice gives the wine a very distinctive coppery hue.

Carmel...the proportions are a very proprietary secret). The result is a wine of incredible depth, complexity, and focus- very serious Pinot."
2895,Au Bon Climat Isabelle Pinot Noir 2012,,California,Red Wine,93,"Isabelle is comprised of the best cuvees each year from all the wines Au Bon Climat produces and that represents at least 6 different vineyards. The 2012 is a darker, luscious, fruitier Isabelle. It has an intensely perfumed, black raspberry nose with sexy floral and mineral qualities that gain power with air. This one needed no bottle time to show well. Isabelle has proven to age very well, and we routinely drink bottles with 15 years of age. Even though Isabelle is Au Bon Climat's ""biggest"" Pinot Noir with loads of intensity and power, it is still balanced and food friendly."

The criteria this time was purely vineyard oriented. Jim Clendenen would select each year the best performing vineyard sections among the 58 acres of estate Pinot fruit he has planted since 1994. It would be a combination, half-and-half, of the best expression of the new Dijon clone plantings, and the best annual traditional California selections. This wine is bright, focused and beautifully delineated. A wine of precision and focus that exudes energy from start to finish. "

2912,Au Bon Climat Rincon Talley Vineyard Pinot Noir 2010,,"Central Coast, California",Red Wine,90,"Talley Pinot, grown in the Arroyo Grande Valley of southern San Luis Obispo County, is typically the first Pinot Noir we harvest each year. The quality of Talley Vineyards Pinot was evident from the very first harvest in 1991 and remains one of our best vineyard sources. The 2010 release is our 19th vintage. These grapes are hand-harvested in the early morning so the grapes arrive at our winery cold. The first signs of an active fermentation were seen after a three day cold soak. Fermentation took 10 days to reach dryness, during which the must was punched down twice a day by hand.  The wine was barreled down to all new François Freres barrels, after pressing and a short settling, and aged for 18 months. We did a light egg white fining to ""soften"" the obvious tannins typically seen in Pinot grown at Talley Vineyards. "
2913,Au Bon Climat Sanford and Benedict Chardonnay 2007,,"Central Coast, California",White Wine,95,"For a region known for its cool climate fruit, Santa Rita Hills appellation is HOT right now, and global warming has nothing to do with it.

2915,Au Bon Climat Sanford and Benedict Chardonnay 2014,,"Santa Ynez Valley, Santa Barbara, Central Coast, California",White Wine,92,"The flavor profile for this well structured Chardonnay is in the subtle pear and apple realm with accents of lavender and anise from the time in barrel. The citrusy notes of lemon and orange will evolve into more of a mineral and saline quality.  Over time, additional flavors and aromas will emerge as the wine expands. As a young Chardonnay, this wine pairs well with any fish, salmon to trout. With age the wine matches will increase to dishes with mushrooms and game birds."

2982,Aubert Reuling Vineyard Pinot Noir 2009,,"Sonoma Coast, Sonoma County, California",Red Wine,92,"This is a stunning set of wines from Mark Aubert. Both the Chardonnays and Pinots developed considerably over the time I followed them. Readers should open the wines at least several hours in advance. In general, the 2010s are brighter and more focused than the 2009s, which are more generous. Alcohol levels are also lower across the board in 2010. The Chardonnays spend 10-12 months in barrel, followed by 2 months in oak, and are usually bottled around Christmas. The cellar is kept cold to encourage slow malos, which occur in the spring. The wines are never racked until they are prepared for bottling with no fining or filtration. The Pinots begin their vinification with cold soaks that last 5-6 days. The wines are only racked when they are bottled, which usually takes place in September. Aubert describes his Pinots as largely inspired by his experiences with the Cabernet Sauvignon-based wines he made at a number of properties, including Colgin, Sloan, Bryant and Futo, which remains his only consulting client. Stylistically, the Pinots are big, bold and highly expressive. Much the same can be said of the Chardonnays. The 2010 Pinots are more pointed and vibrant than the 2009s, a year in which the fruit ripened evenly as there were no rains."

2993,Aubert Ritchie Vineyard Pinot Noir (1.5L Magnum) 2009,,"Sonoma Coast, Sonoma County, California",Red Wine,90,"Deep red color and very good natural clarity; please note how aromatically perfumed this wine is. A first for Aubert, aromatics of cherry cola that they only have in this bottling! Varietal correct aromatics are very apparent in this wine. Initially, Mark Aubert finds blood orange, cinnamon, a lot of sweet-wet leaves and clay soil abound from the glass. After the primary fruits change then there are the tell tale red Burgundy signatures of a great vintage in the Cote du Nuits. Across the palate you feel the ripeness and how suave the 2009 vintage is. The wine finishes with some acid structure that will allow further development in the bottle."

An initial blend of freshly squeezed strawberry and red cherry juice on the nose. The soil influence abounds in 2012, and expresses sarsaparilla, rose oil and black tea.  The palate is rich and pliant, and is the most approachable of the 2012 Pinot Noirs in 2014 according to Mark Aubert. Suggested drinking window is now until 2025."

3000,Aubert Sugar Shack Estate Chardonnay (1.5L Magnum) 2013,,"Alexander Valley, Sonoma County, California",White Wine,93,"We are astonished by the similarities Sugar Shack draws to its Sonoma cousins. Initial aromatics truly reflect the site and winemaking with dried lemon peel, citrus blossom and buttered pecans. The clonal pedigree layers undertones of green tea and crushed rocks. The wine's rich, opulent viscosity draws similarities to our 2012 Chardonnays.

Initial intensities of lemon meringue, candied citrus and dried papaya offer more primary notes. Secondary nuances of honeysuckle, graham cracker and spiced apple offer intrigue and oenological insight.

3037,Auguste Clape Cornas 2006,,"Cornas, Rhone, France",Red Wine,94,"Monsieur Clape's Cornas is systematically considered the best in the appellation, constantly attaining the most amazing levels of excellence. There is always a extremely deep purple, almost black color that exudes a never ending array of rich complex aromas of dried fruits, liquorice, spice and pepper. The sheer power and concentration of the wine on the palate is overwhelming. The attack is sensational, followed with an incredible volume of extract that saturates the palate in rich, concentrated fruity tannins that last through a magnificently long, stunning finish. These wines need at least 5 or 6 years in bottle before they will open up, but are at their best after 10 years."

The nose is typical of Howell Mountain Cabernet and features ripe plum, cedar, tobacco, and white pepper. On the palate, the core of boysenberry, plum and cassis that defined the 2006 Aurielle remains but the fruit flavors are brighter and more layered and there is a bit more acid to compliment the intense fruit. "

3057,Australian Domaine Wines The Hattrick 2000,,Australia,Red Wine,87,"The Hattrick is a blend of 47% Shiraz, 46% Grenache and 7% Cabernet Sauvignon sourced primarily from the Tony DeLisio managed Mark Woods Old Estate just north of the township of McLaren Vale.  To supplement the best of his own fruit, and to enhance complexity, Tony sourced carefully managed, select parcels from a small clutch of vineyards with some of the best old vines in the region.  Each varietal was individually open-vat fermented and basket pressed before going to barrel.  The Shiraz and Cabernet components saw mainly new French with some American Oak.  Progressively, as the wines developed, particular barrels were earmarked for The Hattrick based on what they could contribute to the overall style.  The Grenache was beautifully soft and aromatic overall while the Shiraz showed power and length and the Cabernet a pure varietal structure with character and firmness.  Bench trials led to the final blend decision after which minor additions were made subject to the way the flavours melded in the finished form."
